After completing this unit, you'll be able to:
        Describe two use cases for validation rules.
        List the elements of a validation rule.
        Create a validation rule.
      
    
  



  
    Introduction to Validation Rules
  
  
    Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meets the standards you specify before they can save it. A validation rule can contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “True” or “False.” When the validation rule returns a value of "True", this confirms that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. Validation rules can also include error messages to display to users when they enter invalid values based on specified criteria. Using these rules effectively contributes to quality data. For example, you can ensure that all phone number fields contain a specified format or that discounts applied to certain products never exceed a defined percentage.
    
      Defining Validation Rules
    
  


  
    You can create validation rules for objects, fields, campaign members, or case milestones. In these steps, we create a validation rule that fires when a user tries to save an account with an account number of incorrect length.
    
      Creating a Validation Rule
    
    
      
        From Setup, go to Object Manager and click Account.
        In the left sidebar, click Validation Rules.
        Click New.
        Enter the following properties for your validation rule:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Rule Name: Account_Number_8_Characters&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Error Condition Formula:LEN( AccountNumber) != 8Copy
        
        Error Message: Account number must be 8 characters long.
        To check your formula for errors, click Check Syntax.
        Click Save to finish.
      
      Here’s how a validation rule’s error message can appear when a user types an incorrect account number format into a field.
      
    
  



  
    Examples of Validation Rules
  
  
    Here are some validation rule examples that you can try out yourself.
    
      
        Account Number Is Numeric
      
      The AND function returns a value of "True" if all values in the formula are true, and a value of "False" if one or more values are false. The ISBLANK function determines if an expression has a value. The ISNUMBER function determines if an expression's value is a number. The NOT function determines if the inverse of an expression is true. In the example, the validation rule determines if an account number is both not blank and not a number. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters a non-numeric value for an account number, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message . &nbsp;
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that the Account Number is numeric if not blank.
            
            
              Formula:
              
                
	AND(
   NOT(ISBLANK(AccountNumber)),
   NOT(ISNUMBER(AccountNumber))
)Copy
                
              
            
            
              Error Message:
              Account Number is not numeric.
            
            
              Error Location:
              Account Number
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Date Must Be in the Current Year
      
      The YEAR function returns the four-digit year of a given date. The TODAY function returns the current date. The &lt;&gt; (Not Equal) operator determines if a value is not equal to another value (if it is either less than or greater than the other value.) In the example, the validation rule determines if the year of a given date is not equal to the year of today’s date. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters a date that is not in the current year, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message.
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that a custom date field contains a date within the current year.
            
            
              Formula:
              YEAR( My_Date__c ) &lt;&gt; YEAR ( TODAY() )
            
            
              Error Message:
              Date must be in the current year.
            
            
              Error Location:
              My Date
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Number Range Validation
      
      In the example, the validation rule determines if the difference between two values (Salary Max and Salary Min) is greater than $20,000. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters two values whose difference exceeds the $20,000 salary range, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message.
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that the range between two custom fields, Salary Min and Salary Max, is no greater than $20,000.
            
            
              Formula:
              
                
(Salary_Max__c - Salary_Min__c) &gt; 20000Copy
                
              
            
            
              Error Message:
              Salary range must be within $20,000. Adjust the Salary Max or Salary Min values.
            
            
              Error Location:
              Salary Max
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Website Extension
      
      The AND function returns a value of "True" if all values in the formula are true, and a value of "False" if one or more values are false. The &lt;&gt; (Not Equal) operator determines if a value is not equal (is either less than or greater than) another value. In the example, if the user enters a website URL with an extension that is not equal to (is either greater than or less than) &nbsp;all six of the valid extensions, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message. If the user enters a website URL with an extension that is identical to (is not greater than or less than) one of the valid extensions, the validation rule returns a response of "False" and does not send an error message, because the data the user entered is valid.
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates a custom field called Web Site to ensure that its last four characters are in an explicit set of valid website extensions.
            
            
              Formula:
              
                
AND(
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".COM",
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".com",
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".ORG",
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".org",
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".NET",
   RIGHT( Web_Site__c, 4) &lt;&gt; ".net"
 )Copy
                
              
            
            
              Error Message:
              Web Site must have an extension of .com, .org, or .net .
            
            
              Error Location:
              Web Site
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Valid Billing Country
      
      The OR function returns a "True" response if one or more expressions in the formula are true, and returns a "False" response if all expressions are false. The LEN function returns the number of characters in a specified text string. In the example, the validation rule determines if the value that the user entered for a Billing Country code is either one character (instead of the required two), or does not contain one of the valid two-character codes. If either of these conditions is true, the validation rule returns a value of "True" and sends an error message. If the user enters a valid Billing Country code, both expressions in the formula are false: the LEN is not 1, and the data does contain one of the valid values. In this case, the validation rule returns a value of "False" and does not send an error message.
