First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

We figure you already grasp the concept of object-oriented design, so we’re not going to waste your time describing cookie cutters. Just know that Apex supports many of the object-oriented principles that you’re probably used to, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and even polymorphism. In fact, the Apex language includes many language constructs you’re already familiar with, including classes, interfaces, properties, and collections.

Remember, an sObject is just a Salesforce object. You can think of it as a table in a database. The sObject can be either a standard one that comes built in with Salesforce or a custom one that you define yourself.

But watch out, because these aren’t the same enums you’re used to working with in .NET. In Apex, you can use enums with numbers, but you can’t define what these number values are. Also, the ordinal assignment starts at zero. For example, if you had an enum like the following.

Working with Collections
.NET supports a large collection library with numerous types and extension methods. And here’s some good news. Apex has only the following three collections. Talk about simple, right?

2023-04-02 22:12:45,430 - INFO - Processed paragraph 23 in d1.txt: List
A list is an ordered collection of elements that works much the same as a traditional array. In fact, arrays in Apex are synonymous with lists, and you can use them interchangeably. For example, the following is one way to declare a variable as a list of strings.
2023-04-02 22:12:45,430 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-02 22:12:55,569 - INFO - Processed paragraph 24 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings =  new List<String>();
Alternatively, you can declare the myStrings variable as an array but assign it to a list rather than an array.

2023-04-02 22:12:57,513 - INFO - Processed paragraph 25 in d1.txt: String[] myStrings = new List<String>();
Another thing you can do is declare the list and initialize its values, all in one step, such as the following.
2023-04-02 22:12:57,513 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-02 22:12:58,441 - INFO - Processed paragraph 26 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings =  new List<String> {'String1', 'String2', 'String3' };
You can also add values to the list after it has been created, such as this:
2023-04-02 22:12:58,441 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-02 22:13:02,537 - INFO - Processed paragraph 27 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings = new List<String>();
myStrings.add('String1');
myStrings.add('String2');
myStrings.add('String3');
You’ll probably create a lot of list variables in your Apex development, because the output of every SOQL query is a list. For example, you could create a list of Accounts using code such as the following:
2023-04-02 22:13:02,537 - INFO - Related goals: Given a scenario, use and apply Apex control flow statements.
2023-04-02 22:13:06,336 - INFO - Processed paragraph 28 in d1.txt: List<Account> myAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];
Like arrays, lists have indexes that start at zero. So you could access the name of the first account in the list with code like this:
2023-04-02 22:13:06,336 - INFO - Related goals: Given a scenario, use and apply Apex control flow statements.
2023-04-02 22:13:11,310 - INFO - Processed paragraph 29 in d1.txt: List<Account> myAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];
String firstAccount = myAccounts[0].Name;
Set
A set is an unordered collection of elements that does not contain duplicates. A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique. You could then use the set as part of a WHERE clause in a SOQL query. For example, here we’re creating a set that contains two unique IDs for Accounts. We then use the set in the SOQL query to return Accounts only for those IDs.

List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Name
  FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];    
Map
A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a single value. A map is useful when you need to quickly find something by a key. The key values must be unique, so you could have a map that contained ID values for the key and then mapped to an sObject. For example, you could use the following code to declare a map variable named accountMap that contains all Accounts mapped to their IDs.
2023-04-02 22:13:15,745 - INFO - Related goals: Given a scenario, determine, create, and access the appropriate data model including objects, fields, relationships, and external IDs.

You could then access a specific Account record using the get method and code similar to the following.

Apex code and the Lightning Platform database are tightly coupled to the point where they are sometimes indistinguishable. Each standard or custom object in the database has a "mystical" representation via an Apex class that provides all sorts of functionality to make interacting with the database a snap. The class and its underlying object are essentially a mirror image of one another that is constantly in sync. For instance, whenever you create a new field in an object, a class member is automatically surfaced to reference the values in the database. It's also impossible to add a reference in your Apex code to a field that doesn't exist; the compiler will return an error and simply not save your code. The platform works hard to ensure these dependencies and won't let the database schema and your code become out of sync. Therefore, if you attempt to delete a custom object or a field that is referenced by Apex code, the platform will raise an error and disallow the action.

It’s considered a best practice to use only one trigger per object, which you see in the following example. You can then use context-specific handler methods within triggers to create logic-less triggers. By adopting this practice, you can avoid the common pitfalls that new developers fall into. To learn more about these techniques, check out Trigger Frameworks and Apex Trigger Best Practices.

Making callouts to external web services. Callouts can take a long time to process, but in the Lightning Platform, triggers can’t make callouts directly.
Creating a better and faster user experience by offloading some processing to asynchronous calls. Why do everything at once? If it can wait, let it.
Future Methods
In situations where you need to make a callout to a web service or want to offload simple processing to an asynchronous task, creating a future method could be the way to go.

        // you cannot pass objects as arguments to future methods
        List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, LastName, FirstName, Email
            FROM Contact WHERE Id IN :ids];
        // Loop through the results and call a method
        // which contains the code to do the actual callout
        for (Contact con: contacts) {
            String response = anotherClass.calloutMethod(con.Id,
                con.FirstName,
                con.LastName,

Have we talked about limits yet?
And Then There Was Queueable Apex
For a long time, future methods and the batchable interface were the primary ways developers had to do asynchronous processing. But remember all those limitations we talked about? Well, they were causing problems for some developers, so there was an outcry for a better solution.

It represents the best of future methods and the batchable interface, all rolled up into one super-duper asynchronous tool. Developers forced to use the slower batchable interface to get around limitations of future methods could now return to a tool that made more sense. Queueable Apex provides the following benefits to future methods.

One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

Seriously, after you get to know more about the Lightning Platform, you’ll appreciate it as much as we do. In this module, we’ll look at how you can relate the .NET concepts that you’re already familiar with to the Lightning Platform.

First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

The Apex programming language is similar to one you probably already know and love—C#. Apex is saved, compiled, and executed directly on the Lightning Platform. Like C#, it’s object oriented. In this section, we’ll go over this and what else makes it similar to .NET languages.

We figure you already grasp the concept of object-oriented design, so we’re not going to waste your time describing cookie cutters. Just know that Apex supports many of the object-oriented principles that you’re probably used to, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and even polymorphism. In fact, the Apex language includes many language constructs you’re already familiar with, including classes, interfaces, properties, and collections.

Paragraph:
"""But!—and here’s the part that might make you feel a little weird at first—you, as the developer, have to give up some control to get that developer productivity. On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

Paragraph:
"""Apex Basics
Because the Lightning Platform is so tightly integrated and relies on a metadata architecture, you can accomplish an awful lot using declarative development, or what is known as “point-and-click” app building. If you are new to the Lightning Platform, we strongly suggest you check out the article about point-and-click development listed in Resources.

Paragraph:
"""As .NET developers, you’re probably already familiar with the cloud applications that run on Microsoft Azure. Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform.

2023-04-03 20:53:28,169 - INFO - Processed paragraph 5 in d1.txt: As .NET developers, you’re probably already familiar with the cloud applications that run on Microsoft Azure. Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

Paragraph:
"""But!—and here’s the part that might make you feel a little weird at first—you, as the developer, have to give up some control to get that developer productivity. On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

Paragraph:
"""But!—and here’s the part that might make you feel a little weird at first—you, as the developer, have to give up some control to get that developer productivity. On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

Paragraph:
"""As a .NET developer, we know you like to code, but what you must realize is that on the Lightning Platform, code is not always needed. But it’s important to understand when code is needed and when it isn’t. You can learn more about this distinction by browsing this article on when to click and when to write code.

Paragraph:
"""But!—and here’s the part that might make you feel a little weird at first—you, as the developer, have to give up some control to get that developer productivity. On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

We figure you already grasp the concept of object-oriented design, so we’re not going to waste your time describing cookie cutters. Just know that Apex supports many of the object-oriented principles that you’re probably used to, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and even polymorphism.

"""

Paragraph:
"""public with sharing class HelloWorld {
    public void printMessage() {
        String msg = 'Hello World';
        System.debug(msg);   
    }
}
This simple HelloWorld class includes one method named printMessage that is used to simply output the message “Hello World” to the system debug log. Of course, this example is pretty simple, but we wanted you to see how very similar Apex is to C#.

"""As .NET developers, you’re probably already familiar with the cloud applications that run on Microsoft Azure. Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

"""But!—and here’s the part that might make you feel a little weird at first—you, as the developer, have to give up some control to get that developer productivity. On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

The Apex programming language is similar to one you probably already know and love—C#. Apex is saved, compiled, and executed directly on the Lightning Platform. Like C#, it’s object oriented. In this section, we’ll go over this and what else makes it similar to .NET languages.

We figure you already grasp the concept of object-oriented design, so we’re not going to waste your time describing cookie cutters. Just know that Apex supports many of the object-oriented principles that you’re probably used to, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and even polymorphism. In fact, the Apex language includes many language constructs you’re already familiar with, including classes, interfaces, properties, and collections.

You’ll probably create a lot of list variables in your Apex development, because the output of every SOQL query is a list. For example, you could create a list of Accounts using code such as the following:

String firstAccount = myAccounts[0].Name;
Set
A set is an unordered collection of elements that does not contain duplicates. A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique. You could then use the set as part of a WHERE clause in a SOQL query. For example, here we’re creating a set that contains two unique IDs for Accounts. We then use the set in the SOQL query to return Accounts only for those IDs.

  FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];    
Map
A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a single value. A map is useful when you need to quickly find something by a key. The key values must be unique, so you could have a map that contained ID values for the key and then mapped to an sObject. For example, you could use the following code to declare a map variable named accountMap that contains all Accounts mapped to their IDs.

2023-04-03 21:07:20,304 - INFO - Processed paragraph 41 in d1.txt: Apex and Database are Tightly Coupled
Apex code and the Lightning Platform database are tightly coupled to the point where they are sometimes indistinguishable. Each standard or custom object in the database has a "mystical" representation via an Apex class that provides all sorts of functionality to make interacting with the database a snap. The class and its underlying object are essentially a mirror image of one another that is constantly in sync. For instance, whenever you create a new field in an object, a class member is automatically surfaced to reference the values in the database. It's also impossible to add a reference in your Apex code to a field that doesn't exist; the compiler will return an error and simply not save your code. The platform works hard to ensure these dependencies and won't let the database schema and your code become out of sync. Therefore, if you attempt to delete a custom object or a field that is referenced by Apex code, the platform will raise an error and disallow the action.

The good news here is that in the Lightning Platform you don’t have to worry about authentication or storing passwords and database connection strings. Identity is handled by the platform. You can control access to data at many different levels, including object level, record level, and field level. Security is also handled declaratively. In many cases, security is defined and set up by a Salesforce administrator. As a developer, it’s important to be aware of how it works. Learn more by checking out the Data Security module.

For ASP.NET applications, code is executed in the context of an application domain. In the Lightning Platform world, code executes within an execution context. In a nutshell, this context represents the time between when the code is executed and when it ends. The important thing for you to understand is that the Apex code you write is not always the only code that is executing.

Web Services	Code that is exposed via SOAP or REST web services.
Email Services	Code that is set up to process inbound email.
Visualforce or Lightning Pages	Visualforce controllers and Lightning components can execute Apex code automatically or when a user initiates an action, such as clicking a button. Lightning components can also be executed by Lightning processes and flows.
Besides invoking Apex code, actions, such as creating a new task, sending an email, performing a field update, or sending an outbound message, can all be triggered by one of the declarative platform features. These actions also run within an execution context.

It’s considered a best practice to use only one trigger per object, which you see in the following example. You can then use context-specific handler methods within triggers to create logic-less triggers. By adopting this practice, you can avoid the common pitfalls that new developers fall into.

Well, because Salesforce is a multi-tenanted environment, those governor limits are vital in keeping each instance of a Salesforce org from consuming too many resources. Essentially, they keep the whole system from crashing.

First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

Working with Collections
.NET supports a large collection library with numerous types and extension methods. And here’s some good news. Apex has only the following three collections. Talk about simple, right?

A list is an ordered collection of elements that works much the same as a traditional array. In fact, arrays in Apex are synonymous with lists, and you can use them interchangeably. For example, the following is one way to declare a variable as a list of strings.

2023-04-03 21:11:00,706 - INFO - This paragraph does not relate to any of the learning goals listed in the provided excerpt. It simply provides an example of how to create and add values to a list variable in Apex development.

myStrings.add('String1');
myStrings.add('String2');
myStrings.add('String3');
You’ll probably create a lot of list variables in your Apex development, because the output of every SOQL query is a list. For example, you could create a list of Accounts using code such as the following:
2023-04-03 21:11:00,720 - INFO - No related goals found

2023-04-03 21:11:05,694 - INFO - This paragraph relates to goal number 8, which is to "Given a scenario, write SOSL, SOQL, and DML statements in Apex." The paragraph provides an example of a SOQL query being used to retrieve data from a collection of Account objects. Additionally, it introduces the concept of sets and how they can be used in the WHERE clause of a SOQL query to filter data.

String firstAccount = myAccounts[0].Name;
Set
A set is an unordered collection of elements that does not contain duplicates. A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique. You could then use the set as part of a WHERE clause in a SOQL query. For example, here we’re creating a set that contains two unique IDs for Accounts. We then use the set in the SOQL query to return Accounts only for those IDs.

  FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];    
Map
A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a single value. A map is useful when you need to quickly find something by a key. The key values must be unique, so you could have a map that contained ID values for the key and then mapped to an sObject. For example, you could use the following code to declare a map variable named accountMap that contains all Accounts mapped to their IDs.

First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

This paragraph relates to the learning goal [6] which requires the learner to have the knowledge and skills to declare variables, constants, methods, and use modifiers and Apex interfaces. In the given paragraph, the author explains the concept of a list in Apex programming language, which is an ordered collection of elements that works similar to a traditional array. The paragraph also demonstrates an example of how to declare a variable as a list of strings in Apex. This knowledge is crucial for developers who need to work with data in Apex and want to use lists as a data structure to hold and manipulate data effectively. Therefore, understanding the concept of a list and how to declare variables as lists is essential for achieving this learning goal.
2023-04-03 21:13:09,785 - INFO - Processed paragraph 23 in d1.txt: List
A list is an ordered collection of elements that works much the same as a traditional array. In fact, arrays in Apex are synonymous with lists, and you can use them interchangeably. For example, the following is one way to declare a variable as a list of strings.

You’ll probably create a lot of list variables in your Apex development, because the output of every SOQL query is a list. For example, you could create a list of Accounts using code such as the following:

Set
A set is an unordered collection of elements that does not contain duplicates. A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique. You could then use the set as part of a WHERE clause in a SOQL query. For example, here we’re creating a set that contains two unique IDs for Accounts. We then use the set in the SOQL query to return Accounts only for those IDs.

Map
A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a single value. A map is useful when you need to quickly find something by a key. The key values must be unique, so you could have a map that contained ID values for the key and then mapped to an sObject. For example, you could use the following code to declare a map variable named accountMap that contains all Accounts mapped to their IDs.

This information is critical for developers to understand when creating and accessing the appropriate data model, including objects, fields, relationships, and external IDs, based on a given scenario.
2023-04-03 21:13:43,028 - INFO - Processed paragraph 41 in d1.txt: Apex and Database are Tightly Coupled
Apex code and the Lightning Platform database are tightly coupled to the point where they are sometimes indistinguishable. Each standard or custom object in the database has a "mystical" representation via an Apex class that provides all sorts of functionality to make interacting with the database a snap. The class and its underlying object are essentially a mirror image of one another that is constantly in sync. For instance, whenever you create a new field in an object, a class member is automatically surfaced to reference the values in the database. It's also impossible to add a reference in your Apex code to a field that doesn't exist; the compiler will return an error and simply not save your code. The platform works hard to ensure these dependencies and won't let the database schema and your code become out of sync. Therefore, if you attempt to delete a custom object or a field that is referenced by Apex code, the platform will raise an error and disallow the action.

Note
It’s considered a best practice to use only one trigger per object, which you see in the following example. You can then use context-specific handler methods within triggers to create logic-less triggers. By adopting this practice, you can avoid the common pitfalls that new developers fall into. To learn more about these techniques, check out Trigger Frameworks and Apex Trigger Best Practices.

Specifically, it covers the use case for asynchronous processing and making callouts to external web services, which are best implemented using future methods in Apex programming. This information is relevant in deciding whether to use declarative or programmatic customizations to achieve a specific goal and to understand the governor limits associated with each approach.
2023-04-03 21:15:53,560 - INFO - Processed paragraph 6 in d3.txt: Processing a very large number of records. This reason is unique to the multi-tenanted world of the Lightning Platform where limits rule. The limits associated with asynchronous processes are higher than those with synchronous processes. Therefore, if you need to process thousands or even millions of records, asynchronous processing is your best bet.
Making callouts to external web services. Callouts can take a long time to process, but in the Lightning Platform, triggers can’t make callouts directly.
Creating a better and faster user experience by offloading some processing to asynchronous calls. Why do everything at once? If it can wait, let it.
Future Methods
In situations where you need to make a callout to a web service or want to offload simple processing to an asynchronous task, creating a future method could be the way to go.

2023-04-03 21:15:55,253 - INFO - This paragraph does not relate to any of the learning goals mentioned. It instead provides a brief explanation of how to change a method from synchronous to asynchronous processing using the @future annotation in Apex.
2023-04-03 21:15:55,266 - INFO - Processed paragraph 7 in d3.txt: Changing a method from synchronous to asynchronous processing is amazingly easy. Essentially, you just add the @future annotation to your method. Other than that, just make sure that the method is static and returns only a void type. For example, to create a method for performing a web service callout, we could do something like this:
2023-04-03 21:15:55,266 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-03 21:16:00,432 - INFO - The paragraph relates to [19] Write and execute tests for triggers, controllers, classes, flows, and processes using various sources of test data. 

The paragraph shows an example of an Apex code for a future method, which should be tested to ensure its functionality is correct. Writing and executing tests for triggers, controllers, classes, flows, and processes are essential for developers to ensure that their code works as expected and does not negatively impact other areas of the system. In this case, the MyFutureClass method is executed asynchronously, making it even more important to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
2023-04-03 21:16:00,446 - INFO - Processed paragraph 8 in d3.txt: public class MyFutureClass {
    // Include callout=true when making callouts

        // Get the list of contacts in the future method since
        // you cannot pass objects as arguments to future methods
        List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, LastName, FirstName, Email
            FROM Contact WHERE Id IN :ids];
        // Loop through the results and call a method
        // which contains the code to do the actual callout
        for (Contact con: contacts) {
            String response = anotherClass.calloutMethod(con.Id,
                con.FirstName,
                con.LastName,
                con.Email);
            // May want to add some code here to log
            // the response to a custom object
        }
    }
}
We could then call it just like we would any other static method. Easy peasy!

Set Checkpoints
As a .NET developer, you’re used to setting breakpoints in your applications. But in a cloud-based, multi-tenanted environment where everyone is sharing resources, allowing everyone to halt execution and keep database connections open is disastrous.

  We're excited to accompany you on your Apex adventure. While this module covers basic information about the programming language, it also goes deep, quickly. If this module is your first exposure to Apex, we highly recommend that you first go through the Quick Start: Apex&nbsp;project. Then come on back, we'll be waiting for you!
  
    What is Apex?
  
  
    Apex is a programming language that uses Java-like syntax and acts like database stored procedures. Apex enables developers to add business logic to system events, such as button clicks, updates of related records, and Visualforce pages.
    As a language, Apex is:
    
      Hosted—Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the server—the Lightning Platform.
      Object oriented—Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
      Strongly typed—Apex validates references to objects at compile time.
      Multitenant aware—Because Apex runs in a multitenant platform, it guards closely against runaway code by enforcing limits, which prevent code from monopolizing shared resources.
      Integrated with the database—It is straightforward to access and manipulate records. Apex provides direct access to records and their fields, and provides statements and query languages to manipulate those records.
      Data focused—Apex provides transactional access to the database, allowing you to roll back operations.
      Easy to use—Apex is based on familiar Java idioms.
      Easy to test—Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation, execution, and code coverage. Salesforce ensures that all custom Apex code works as expected by executing all unit tests prior to any platform upgrades.
      Versioned—Custom Apex code can be saved against different versions of the API.
    
    
      
    
    
      Apex Language Highlights
      Like other object-oriented programming languages, these are some of the language constructs that Apex supports:
      
        Classes, interfaces, properties, and collections (including arrays).
        Object and array notation.
        Expressions, variables, and constants.
        Conditional statements (if-then-else) and control flow statements (for loops and while loops).
      
      Unlike other object-oriented programming languages, Apex supports:
      
        Cloud development as Apex is stored, compiled, and executed in the cloud.
        Triggers, which are similar to triggers in database systems.
        Database statements that allow you to make direct database calls and query languages to query and search data.
        Transactions and rollbacks.
        The global access modifier, which is more permissive than the public modifier and allows access across namespaces and applications.
        Versioning of custom code.
      
      In addition, Apex is a case-insensitive language.
    
    
      Development Tools
      You can write and debug Apex on your client computer using the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code. See Salesforce Visual Studio Code Extensions.
      You can also write Apex and access debugging information directly in the browser by using the Salesforce user interface. Open the Developer Console under Your Name or the quick access menu ().

    Apex supports various data types, including a data type specific to Salesforce—the sObject data type.
    
      Apex supports the following data types.
      
        A primitive, such as an Integer, Double, Long, Date, Datetime, String, ID, Boolean, among others.
        An sObject, either as a generic sObject or as a specific sObject, such as an Account, Contact, or MyCustomObject__c (you’ll learn more about sObjects in a later unit.)
        A collection, including:
            A list (or array) of primitives, sObjects, user defined objects, objects created from Apex classes, or collections
            A set of primitives, sObjects, user defined objects, objects created from Apex classes, or collections
            A map from a primitive to a primitive, sObject, or collection
          
        
        A typed list of values, also known as an enum

        System-supplied Apex classes
      
    
    
      
        Apex Collections: List
      
      Lists hold an ordered collection of objects. Lists in Apex are synonymous with arrays and the two can be used interchangeably.
      The following two declarations are equivalent. The colors variable is declared using the List syntax.
      
List&lt;String&gt; colors = new List&lt;String&gt;();Copy
      
      Alternatively, the colors variable can be declared as an array but assigned to a list rather than an array.
      
String[] colors = new List&lt;String&gt;();Copy
      
      Grow collections as needed by using the List.add() method to add new elements. Use the square bracket array notation to reference existing elements in the collection by index. You can't, however, use square bracket array notation to add more elements.
      This example shows how to add elements to a list when you create it, and then use the add() method to add more elements.&nbsp;
      
// Create a list and add elements to it in one step
List&lt;String&gt; colors = new List&lt;String&gt; { 'red', 'green', 'blue' };
// Add elements to a list after it has been created
List&lt;String&gt; moreColors = new List&lt;String&gt;();
moreColors.add('orange');
moreColors.add('purple');Copy
      
      List elements can be read by specifying an index between square brackets, just like with array elements. Also, you can use the get() method to read a list element. This example is based on the lists created in the previous example and shows how to read list elements using either method. The example also shows how to iterate over array elements.
      
// Get elements from a list
String color1 = moreColors.get(0);
String color2 = moreColors[0];
System.assertEquals(color1, color2);
// Iterate over a list to read elements
for(Integer i=0;i&lt;colors.size();i++) {
    // Write value to the debug log
    System.debug(colors[i]);
}Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                          
                            Beyond the Basics
                            Apex supports two other collection types: Set and Map. You can learn more about these in the Collections section of the Apex Developer Guide.

    One of the benefits of Apex classes is code reuse. Class methods can be called by triggers and other classes. The following tutorial walks you through saving an example class in your organization, using this class to send emails, and inspecting debug logs.
    
    
    
Save an Apex Class
      Save the EmailManager class in your organization:
      
        Open the Developer Console under Your Name or the quick access menu ().
        In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Class, and enter EmailManager for the class name, and then click OK.
        Replace the default class body with the EmailManager class example.The EmailManager class has a public method (sendMail()) that sends email and uses built-in Messaging methods of the Apex class library. Also, this class has a private helper method (inspectResults()), which can’t be called externally because it is private but is used only within the class. This helper method inspects the results of the email send call and is called by sendMail().public class EmailManager {
    // Public method
    public void sendMail(String address, String subject, String body) {
        // Create an email message object
        Messaging.SingleEmailMessage mail = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
        String[] toAddresses = new String[] {address};
        mail.setToAddresses(toAddresses);
        mail.setSubject(subject);
        mail.setPlainTextBody(body);
        // Pass this email message to the built-in sendEmail method 
        // of the Messaging class
        Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results = Messaging.sendEmail(
                                 new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[] { mail });
        // Call a helper method to inspect the returned results
        inspectResults(results);
    }
    // Helper method
    private static Boolean inspectResults(Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results) {
        Boolean sendResult = true;
        // sendEmail returns an array of result objects.
        // Iterate through the list to inspect results. 
        // In this class, the methods send only one email, 
        // so we should have only one result.
        for (Messaging.SendEmailResult res : results) {
            if (res.isSuccess()) {
                System.debug('Email sent successfully');
            }
            else {
                sendResult = false;
                System.debug('The following errors occurred: ' + res.getErrors());                 
            }
        }
        return sendResult;
    }
}Copy
        
        Click File | Save to save your class.NOTE: If your code isn’t syntactically correct, an error shows up in the Problems tab. You can use the error details to correct your code.
      
    
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Beyond the Basics&nbsp;
                The class you just saved makes use of object-oriented programming (OOP). The class encapsulates the methods that are related to managing email. To be a perfect example of OOP, the class would also contain member variables (attributes) and accessor methods to access those attributes, but for simplicity our class doesn’t have these.Salesforce compiles your class when you save it.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Call a Method to Send an Email
      Let’s invoke the public method. We’ll use anonymous Apex execution to do so. Anonymous Apex allows you to run lines of code on the fly and is a handy way to invoke Apex, especially to test out functionality. Debug log results are generated, as with any other Apex execution.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  There are other ways to invoke Apex, for example, through triggers. You’ll learn more about triggers in another module.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        In the Developer Console, click Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
        In the window that opens, enter the following. Replace 'Your email address' with your email address.EmailManager em = new EmailManager();
em.sendMail('Your email address', 'Trailhead Tutorial', '123 body');Copy
        
        Click Execute.Now that this method has executed, you should have received an email in your inbox. Check your email!
      
    
    
      Inspect Debug Logs
      Debug logs are useful for debugging your code. When Apex methods execute, the calls are logged in the debug log. Also, you can write your own debug messages to the log, which helps in debugging your code in case there are errors. The inspectResults() helper method, which is called by sendMail(), writes messages to the log by using the System.debug() method to indicate whether the email send operation was successful or had errors. You can look for these messages in the debug log that was generated when you executed the method.
      
        In the Developer Console, click the Logs tab and double-click the most recent log in the list.
        Select Debug Only to filter the log so that only log lines for System.debug() statements are shown.

                  Note
                  
                  Also, you can filter the debug log by searching for any keyword in the Filter field, or by selecting any of the other options. For more information, see the Log Inspector help.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      Call a Static Method
      Because the sendMail() method in our class doesn’t access class member variables, it doesn’t need to be an instance method. Let’s change it to a static method by adding the static keyword to its declaration. Static methods are easier to call than instance methods because they don’t need to be called on an instance of the class but are called directly on the class name.
      
        In the Developer Console, find the open tab for the EmailManager class and modify the first line of the sendMail()method definition to the following (the only change is the added statickeyword.)public static void sendMail(String address, String subject, String body) {Copy
        
        Click File | Save to save your class.
        Modify the statements in your Execute Anonymous window to call the static method on the class name.EmailManager.sendMail('Your email address', 'Trailhead Tutorial', '123 body');Copy
        
        Click Execute.Now that this method has executed, you can check your email, and optionally, the debug log as in the previous steps.

    The Apex testing framework enables you to write and execute tests for your Apex classes and triggers on the Lightning Platform. Apex unit tests ensure high quality for your Apex code and let you meet requirements for deploying Apex.
    
      Testing is the key to successful long-term development and is a critical component of the development process. The Apex testing framework makes it easy to test your Apex code. Apex code can only be written in a sandbox environment or a Developer org, not in production. Apex code can be deployed to a production org from a sandbox. Also, app developers can distribute Apex code to customers from their Developer orgs by uploading packages to the Lightning Platform AppExchange. In addition to being critical for quality assurance, Apex unit tests are also requirements for deploying and distributing Apex.&nbsp;
      These are the benefits of Apex unit tests.
      
        Ensuring that your Apex classes and triggers work as expected
        Having a suite of regression tests that can be rerun every time classes and triggers are updated to ensure that future updates you make to your app don’t break existing functionality
        Meeting the code coverage requirements for deploying Apex to production or distributing Apex to customers via packages
        High-quality apps delivered to the production org, which makes production users more productive
        High-quality apps delivered to package subscribers, which increase your customers trust
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Before each major service upgrade, Salesforce runs all Apex tests on your behalf through a process called Apex Hammer. The Hammer process runs in the current version and next release and compares the test results. This process ensures that the behavior in your custom code hasn’t been altered as a result of service upgrades. The Hammer process picks orgs selectively and doesn’t run in all orgs. Issues found are triaged based on certain criteria. Salesforce strives to fix all issues found before each new release.
                  Maintaining the security of your data is our highest priority. We don't view or modify any data in your org, and all testing is done in a copy that runs in a secure data center.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Code Coverage Requirement for Deployment
      
      Before you can deploy your code or package it for the Lightning Platform AppExchange, at least 75% of Apex code must be covered by tests, and all those tests must pass. In addition, each trigger must have some coverage. Even though code coverage is a requirement for deployment, don’t write tests only to meet this requirement. Make sure to test the common use cases in your app, including positive and negative test cases, and bulk and single-record processing.
    
    
      
        Test Method Syntax
      
      Test methods are defined using the @isTest annotation and have the following syntax:
      
@isTest static void testName() {
    // code_block
}Copy
      
      The @isTest annotation takes multiple modifiers within parentheses and separated by blanks. We’ll cover one such parameter later.
      The visibility of a test method doesn’t matter, so declaring a test method as public or private doesn’t make a difference as the testing framework is always able to access test methods. For this reason, the access modifiers are omitted in the syntax.
      Test methods must be defined in test classes, which are classes annotated with @isTest. This sample class shows a definition of a test class with one test method.
      
@isTest
private class MyTestClass {
    @isTest static void myTest() {
        // code_block
    }
}Copy
      
      Test classes can be either private or public. If you’re using a test class for unit testing only, declare it as private. Public test classes are typically used for test data factory classes, which are covered later.
    
    
      
        Unit Test Example: Test the TemperatureConverter Class
      
      The following simple example is of a test class with three test methods. The class method that’s being tested takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as an input. It converts this temperature to Celsius and returns the converted result. Let’s add the custom class and its test class.
      
        In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Class, and enter TemperatureConverter for the class name, and then click OK.
        Replace the default class body with the following.public class TemperatureConverter {
    // Takes a Fahrenheit temperature and returns the Celsius equivalent.
    public static Decimal FahrenheitToCelsius(Decimal fh) {
        Decimal cs = (fh - 32) * 5/9;
        return cs.setScale(2);
    }
}Copy
        
        Press Ctrl+S to save your class.
        Repeat the previous steps to create the TemperatureConverterTestclass. Add the following for this class.@isTest
private class TemperatureConverterTest {
    @isTest static void testWarmTemp() {
        Decimal celsius = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(70);
        System.assertEquals(21.11,celsius);
    }
    @isTest static void testFreezingPoint() {
        Decimal celsius = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(32);
        System.assertEquals(0,celsius);
    }
    @isTest static void testBoilingPoint() {
        Decimal celsius = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(212);        
        System.assertEquals(100,celsius,'Boiling point temperature is not expected.');
    } 
    @isTest static void testNegativeTemp() {
        Decimal celsius = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(-10);
        System.assertEquals(-23.33,celsius);
    }
}Copy
        
      
      The TemperatureConverterTest test class verifies that the method works as expected by calling it with different inputs for the temperature in Fahrenheit. Each test method verifies one type of input: a warm temperature, the freezing point temperature, the boiling point temperature, and a negative temperature. The verifications are done by calling the System.assertEquals() method, which takes two parameters: the first is the expected value, and the second is the actual value. There is another version of this method that takes a third parameter—a string that describes the comparison being done, which is used in testBoilingPoint(). This optional string is logged if the assertion fails.
      Let’s run the methods in this class.
      
        In the Developer Console, click Test | New Run.
        Under Test Classes, click TemperatureConverterTest.
        To add all the test methods in the TemperatureConverterTest class to the test run, click Add Selected.
        Click Run.
        In the Tests tab, you see the status of your tests as they’re running. Expand the test run, and expand again until you see the list of individual tests that were run. They all have green checkmarks.&nbsp;

You can check the code coverage percentage in the Tests tab of the Developer Console. In this example, the class you’ve tested, the TemperatureConverter class, has 100% coverage, as shown in this image.
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Whenever you modify your Apex code, rerun your tests to refresh code coverage results.
                  A known issue with the Developer Console prevents it from updating code coverage correctly when running a subset of tests. To update your code coverage results, use Test | Run All rather than Test | New Run.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      While one test method would have resulted in full coverage of the TemperatureConverter class, it’s still important to test for different inputs to ensure the quality of your code. Obviously, it isn’t possible to verify every data point, but you can test for common data points and different ranges of input. For example, you can verify passing positive and negative numbers, boundary values, and invalid parameter values to verify negative behavior. The tests for the TemperatureConverter class verify common data points, like the boiling temperature, and negative temperatures.
      The TemperatureConverterTest test class doesn’t cover invalid inputs or boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are about minimum and maximum values. In this case, the temperature conversion method accepts a Decimal, which can accept large numbers, higher than Double values. For invalid inputs, there is no invalid temperature but the only invalid input is null. How does the conversion method handle this value? In this case, when the Apex runtime dereferences the parameter variable to evaluate the formula, it throws a System.NullPointerException. You can modify the FahrenheitToCelsius() method to check for an invalid input and return null in that case, and then add a test to verify the invalid input behavior.
      Up to this point, all tests pass because the conversion formula used in the class method is correct. But that’s boring! Let’s try to simulate a failure just to see what happens when an assertion fails. For example, let’s modify the boiling point temperature test and pass in a false expected value for the boiling point Celsius temperature (0 instead of 100). This causes the corresponding test method to fail.
      
        Change the testBoilingPoint()test method to the following.    @isTest static void testBoilingPoint() {
        Decimal celsius = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(212);        
        // Simulate failure
        System.assertEquals(0,celsius,'Boiling point temperature is not expected.');
    }Copy
        
        To execute the same test run, click the latest run in the Tests tab, and then click Test | Rerun.The assertion in testBoilingPoint() fails and throws a fatal error (an AssertException that can’t be caught).
        Check the results in the Tests tab by expanding the latest test run. The test run reports one out of four tests failed. To get more details about the failure, double-click the test run. Detailed results appear in a separate tab as shown in this image.&nbsp;

        Increase Your Code Coverage
      
      When writing tests, try to achieve the highest code coverage possible. Don’t just aim for 75% coverage, which is the lowest coverage that the Lightning Platform requires for deployments and packages. The more test cases that your tests cover, the higher the likelihood that your code is robust. Sometimes, even after you write test methods for all your class methods, code coverage is not at 100%. One common cause is not covering all data values for conditional code execution. For example, some data values tend to be ignored when your class method has if statements that cause different branches to be executed based on whether the evaluated condition is met. Ensure that your test methods account for these different values.
      This example includes the class method, getTaskPriority(), which contains two if statements. The main task of this method is to return a priority string value based on the given lead state. The method validates the state first and returns null if the state is invalid. If the state is CA, the method returns 'High'; otherwise, it returns 'Normal' for any other state value.
      
public class TaskUtil {
    public static String getTaskPriority(String leadState) {
        // Validate input
        if (String.isBlank(leadState) || leadState.length() &gt; 2) {
            return null;
        }
        String taskPriority;
        if (leadState == 'CA') {
             taskPriority = 'High'; 
        } else {
             taskPriority = 'Normal';
        }
        return taskPriority;
    }
}Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The equality operator (==) performs case-insensitive string comparisons, so there is no need to convert the string to lower case first. This means that passing in 'ca' or 'Ca' will satisfy the equality condition with the string literal 'CA'.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      This is the test class for the getTaskPriority() method. The test method simply calls getTaskPriority() with one state ('NY').
      
@isTest
private class TaskUtilTest {
    @isTest static void testTaskPriority() {
        String pri = TaskUtil.getTaskPriority('NY');
        System.assertEquals('Normal', pri);
    }
}Copy
      
      Let’s run this test class (TaskUtilTest) in the Developer Console and check code coverage for the corresponding TaskUtil class that this test covers. After the test run finishes, the code coverage for TaskUtil is shown as 75%. If you open this class in the Developer Console, you see six blue (covered) lines and two red (uncovered) lines, as shown in this image.
      
        
      
      The reason why line 5 wasn’t covered is because our test class didn’t contain a test to pass an invalid state parameter. Similarly, line 11 wasn’t covered because the test method didn’t pass 'CA' as the state. Let’s add two more test methods to cover those scenarios. The following shows the full test class after adding the testTaskHighPriority() and testTaskPriorityInvalid() test methods. If you rerun this test class, the code coverage for TaskUtil is now at 100%!
      
@isTest
private class TaskUtilTest {
    @isTest static void testTaskPriority() {
        String pri = TaskUtil.getTaskPriority('NY');
        System.assertEquals('Normal', pri);
    }
    @isTest static void testTaskHighPriority() {
        String pri = TaskUtil.getTaskPriority('CA');
        System.assertEquals('High', pri);
    }
    @isTest static void testTaskPriorityInvalid() {
        String pri = TaskUtil.getTaskPriority('Montana');
        System.assertEquals(null, pri);
    }
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Create and Execute a Test Suite
      
      A test suite is a collection of Apex test classes that you run together. For example, create a suite of tests that you run every time you prepare for a deployment or Salesforce releases a new version. Set up a test suite in the Developer Console to define a set of test classes that you execute together regularly.
      You now have two test classes in your org. These two classes aren’t related, but let’s pretend for the moment that they are. Assume that there are situations when you want to run these two test classes but don’t want to run all the tests in your org. Create a test suite that contains both classes, and then execute the tests in the suite.
      
        In the Developer Console, select Test | New Suite.
        Enter TempConverterTaskUtilSuite for the suite name, and then click OK.
        Select TaskUtilTest, hold down the Ctrl key, and then select TemperatureConverterTest.
        To add the selected test classes to the suite, click &gt;.&nbsp;

        Select Test | New Suite Run.
        Select TempConverterTaskUtilSuite, and then click &gt; to move TempConverterTaskUtilSuite to the Selected Test Suites column.
        Click Run Suites.
        On the Tests tab, monitor the status of your tests as they’re running. Expand the test run, and expand again until you see the list of individual tests that were run. Like in a run of individual test methods, you can double-click method names to see detailed test results.
      
    
    
      
        Create Test Data
      
      Salesforce records that are created in test methods aren’t committed to the database. They’re rolled back when the test finishes execution. This rollback behavior is handy for testing because you don’t have to clean up your test data after the test executes.
      By default, Apex tests don’t have access to pre-existing data in the org, except for access to setup and metadata objects, such as the User or Profile objects. Set up test data for your tests. Creating test data makes your tests more robust and prevents failures that are caused by missing or changed data in the org. You can create test data directly in your test method, or by using a utility test class as you’ll find out later.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Even though it is not a best practice to do so, there are times when a test method needs access to pre-existing data. To access org data, annotate the test method with @isTest(SeeAllData=true). The test method examples in this unit don’t access org data and therefore don’t use the SeeAllData parameter.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Tell Me More
      
    
    
      
        You can save up to 6 MB of Apex code in each org. Test classes annotated with @isTest don’t count toward this limit.
        Even though test data rolls back, no separate database is used for testing. As a result, for some sObjects that have fields with unique constraints, inserting duplicate sObject records results in an error.
        Test methods don’t send emails.
        Test methods can’t make callouts to external services. You can use mock callouts in tests.
        SOSL searches performed in a test return empty results. To ensure predictable results, use Test.setFixedSearchResults() to define the records to be returned by the search.

2023-04-04 11:11:54,698 - INFO - Processed paragraph 3 in 0_apex_triggers_apex_triggers_intro_content.txt: Writing Apex Triggers
  
  
    Apex triggers enable you to perform custom actions before or after events to records in Salesforce, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. Just like database systems support triggers, Apex provides trigger support for managing records.
    
    Typically, you use triggers to perform operations based on specific conditions, to modify related records or restrict certain operations from happening. You can use triggers to do anything you can do in Apex, including executing SOQL and DML or calling custom Apex methods.
    
    Use triggers to perform tasks that can’t be done by using the point-and-click tools in the Salesforce user interface. For example, if validating a field value or updating a field on a record, use validation rules and flows instead
    
    Triggers can be defined for top-level standard objects, such as Account or Contact, custom objects, and some standard child objects. Triggers are active by default when created. Salesforce automatically fires active triggers when the specified database events occur.
    
      Trigger Syntax
    
    
      The syntax of a trigger definition is different from a class definition’s syntax. A trigger definition starts with the trigger keyword. It is then followed by the name of the trigger, the Salesforce object that the trigger is associated with, and the conditions under which it fires. A trigger has the following syntax:

   code_block
}Copy
        
      
      To execute a trigger before or after insert, update, delete, and undelete operations, specify multiple trigger events in a comma-separated list. The events you can specify are:
          before insert
          before update
          before delete
          after insert
          after update
          after delete
          after undelete
        
      
    
    
      
        Trigger Example
      
      
        This simple trigger fires before you insert an account and writes a message to the debug log.
            In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Trigger.
            Enter HelloWorldTrigger for the trigger name, and then select Account for the sObject. Click Submit.
            Replace the default code with the following.trigger HelloWorldTrigger on Account (before insert) {
	System.debug('Hello World!');
}Copy
            
            To save, press Ctrl+S.
            To test the trigger, create an account.
                Click Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
                In the new window, add the following and then click Execute.Account a = new Account(Name='Test Trigger');

            In the debug log, find the Hello World! statement. The log also shows that the trigger has been executed.
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Types of Triggers
      
      There are two types of triggers.
      
        
Before triggers are used to update or validate record values before they’re saved to the database.
        
After triggers are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.
      
    
    
      
        Using Context Variables
      
      To access the records that caused the trigger to fire, use context variables. For example, Trigger.new contains all the records that were inserted in insert or update triggers. Trigger.old provides the old version of sObjects before they were updated in update triggers, or a list of deleted sObjects in delete triggers. Triggers can fire when one record is inserted, or when many records are inserted in bulk via the API or Apex. Therefore, context variables, such as Trigger.new, can contain only one record or multiple records. You can iterate over Trigger.new to get each individual sObject.
      This example is a modified version of the HelloWorldTrigger example trigger. It iterates over each account in a for loop and updates the Description field for each.
      
trigger HelloWorldTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    for(Account a : Trigger.new) {
        a.Description = 'New description';
    }   
}Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The system saves the records that fired the before trigger after the trigger finishes execution. You can modify the records in the trigger without explicitly calling a DML insert or update operation. If you perform DML statements on those records, you get an error.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      Some other context variables return a Boolean value to indicate whether the trigger was fired due to an update or some other event. These variables are useful when a trigger combines multiple events. For example:
      
trigger ContextExampleTrigger on Account (before insert, after insert, after delete) {
    if (Trigger.isInsert) {
        if (Trigger.isBefore) {
            // Process before insert
        } else if (Trigger.isAfter) {
            // Process after insert
        }        
    }
    else if (Trigger.isDelete) {
        // Process after delete
    }
}Copy

        Calling a Class Method from a Trigger
      
      You can call public utility methods from a trigger. Calling methods of other classes enables code reuse, reduces the size of your triggers, and improves maintenance of your Apex code. It also allows you to use object-oriented programming.
      The following example trigger shows how to call a static method from a trigger. If the trigger was fired because of an insert event, the example calls the static sendMail() method on the EmailManager class. This utility method sends an email to the specified recipient and contains the number of contact records inserted.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The EmailManager class is included in the class example of the Get Started with Apex unit. You must have saved the EmailManager class in your org and changed the sendMail() method to static before saving this trigger.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Trigger.
        Enter ExampleTrigger for the trigger name, and then select Contact for the sObject. Click Submit.
        Replace the default code with the following, and then modify the email address placeholder text in sendMail()to your email address.trigger ExampleTrigger on Contact (after insert, after delete) {
    if (Trigger.isInsert) {
        Integer recordCount = Trigger.new.size();
        // Call a utility method from another class
        EmailManager.sendMail('Your email address', 'Trailhead Trigger Tutorial', 
                    recordCount + ' contact(s) were inserted.');
    }
    else if (Trigger.isDelete) {
        // Process after delete
    }
}Copy
        
        To save, press Ctrl+S.
        To test the trigger, create a contact.
            Click Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
            In the new window, add the following and then click Execute.Contact c = new Contact(LastName='Test Contact');
insert c;Copy
            
          
        
        In the debug log, check that the trigger was fired. Toward the end of the log, find the debug message that was written by the utility method: DEBUG|Email sent successfully

        Adding Related Records
      
      Triggers are often used to access and manage records related to the records in the trigger context—the records that caused this trigger to fire.
      This trigger adds a related opportunity for each new or updated account if no opportunity is already associated with the account. The trigger first performs a SOQL query to get all child opportunities for the accounts that the trigger fired on. Next, the trigger iterates over the list of sObjects in Trigger.new to get each account sObject. If the account doesn’t have any related opportunity sObjects, the for loop creates one. If the trigger created any new opportunities, the final statement inserts them.
      
        Add the following trigger using the Developer Console (follow the steps of the HelloWorldTrigger example but use AddRelatedRecordfor the trigger name).trigger AddRelatedRecord on Account(after insert, after update) {
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; oppList = new List&lt;Opportunity&gt;();
    // Get the related opportunities for the accounts in this trigger
    Map&lt;Id,Account&gt; acctsWithOpps = new Map&lt;Id,Account&gt;(
        [SELECT Id,(SELECT Id FROM Opportunities) FROM Account WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new]);
    // Add an opportunity for each account if it doesn't already have one.
    // Iterate through each account.
    for(Account a : Trigger.new) {
        System.debug('acctsWithOpps.get(a.Id).Opportunities.size()=' + acctsWithOpps.get(a.Id).Opportunities.size());
        // Check if the account already has a related opportunity.
        if (acctsWithOpps.get(a.Id).Opportunities.size() == 0) {
            // If it doesn't, add a default opportunity
            oppList.add(new Opportunity(Name=a.Name + ' Opportunity',
                                       StageName='Prospecting',
                                       CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                       AccountId=a.Id));
        }           
    }
    if (oppList.size() &gt; 0) {
        insert oppList;
    }
}Copy
        
        To test the trigger, create an account in the Salesforce user interface and name it Apples &amp; Oranges.
        In the Opportunities related list on the account’s page, find the new opportunity. The trigger added this opportunity automatically!
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The trigger you’ve added iterates over all records that are part of the trigger context—the for loop iterates over Trigger.new. However, the loop in this trigger could be more efficient. We don’t really need to access every account in this trigger context, but only a subset—the accounts without opportunities. The next unit shows how to make this trigger more efficient. In the Bulk Trigger Design Patterns unit, learn how to modify the SOQL query to get only the accounts with no opportunities. Then, learn to iterate only over those records.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Using Trigger Exceptions
      
    
    
      You sometimes need to add restrictions on certain database operations, such as preventing records from being saved when certain conditions are met. To prevent saving records in a trigger, call the addError() method on the sObject in question. The addError() method throws a fatal error inside a trigger. The error message is displayed in the user interface and is logged.
      The following trigger prevents the deletion of an account if it has related opportunities. By default, deleting an account causes a cascade delete of all its related records. This trigger prevents the cascade delete of opportunities. Try this trigger for yourself! If you’ve executed the previous example, your org has an account called Apples &amp; Oranges&nbsp;with a related opportunity. This example uses that sample account.
      
        Using the Developer Console, add the following trigger.trigger AccountDeletion on Account (before delete) {
    // Prevent the deletion of accounts if they have related opportunities.
    for (Account a : [SELECT Id FROM Account
                     WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity) AND
                     Id IN :Trigger.old]) {
        Trigger.oldMap.get(a.Id).addError(
            'Cannot delete account with related opportunities.');
    }
}Copy
        
        In the Salesforce user interface, navigate to the Apples &amp; Oranges account’s page and click Delete.
        In the confirmation popup, click OK.Find the validation error with the custom error message Cannot delete account with related opportunities.

                 Calling addError()in a trigger causes the entire set of operations to roll back, except when bulk DML is called with partial success.
                    If a bulk DML call in the Lightning Platform API spawned the trigger, the runtime engine sets the bad records aside. The runtime engine then attempts a partial save of the records that did not generate errors.
                    
                      If a DML statement in Apex spawned the trigger, any error rolls back the entire operation. However, the runtime engine still processes every record in the operation to compile a comprehensive list of errors.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Triggers and Callouts
      
      Apex allows you to make calls to and integrate your Apex code with external Web services. Apex calls to external Web services are referred to as callouts. For example, you can make a callout to a stock quote service to get the latest quotes. When making a callout from a trigger, the callout must be done asynchronously so that the trigger process doesn’t block you from working while waiting for the external service's response. The asynchronous callout is made in a background process, and the response is received when the external service returns it.
      To make a callout from a trigger, call a class method that executes asynchronously. Such a method is called a future method and is annotated with @future(callout=true). This example class contains the future method that makes the callout.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The example uses a hypothetical endpoint URL for illustration purposes only. You can’t run this example unless you change the endpoint to a valid URL and add a remote site in Salesforce for your endpoint.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
public class CalloutClass {
    @future(callout=true)
    public static void makeCallout() {
        HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
        // Set the endpoint URL.
        String endpoint = 'http://yourHost/yourService';
        request.setEndPoint(endpoint);
        // Set the HTTP verb to GET.
        request.setMethod('GET');
        // Send the HTTP request and get the response.
        HttpResponse response = new HTTP().send(request);
    }
}Copy
      
      This example shows the trigger that calls the method in the class to make a callout asynchronously.
      
trigger CalloutTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    CalloutClass.makeCallout();
}Copy
      
      This section offers only an overview of callouts and is not intended to cover callouts in detail. For more information, see Invoking Callouts Using Apex in the Apex Developer Guide.

    In a nutshell, asynchronous Apex is used to run processes in a separate thread, at a later time.
    An asynchronous process is a process or function that executes a task "in the background" without the user having to wait for the task to finish.
    Here’s a real-world example. Let’s say you have a list of things to accomplish before your weekly Dance Revolution practice. Your car is making a funny noise, you need a different color hair gel and you have to pick up your uniform from your mom’s house. You could take your car to the mechanic and wait until it is fixed before completing the rest of your list (synchronous processing), or you could leave it there and get your other things done, and have the shop call you when it’s fixed (asynchronous processing). If you want to be home in time to iron your spandex before practice, asynchronous processing allows you to get more stuff done in the same amount of time without the needless waiting.
    You’ll typically use Asynchronous Apex for callouts to external systems, operations that require higher limits, and code that needs to run at a certain time. The key benefits of asynchronous processing include:
User efficiency
    Let's say you have a process that makes many calculations on a custom object whenever an Opportunity is created. The time needed to execute these calculations could range from a minor annoyance to a productivity blocker for the user. Since these calculations don't affect what the user is currently doing, making them wait for a long running process is not an efficient use of their time. With asynchronous processing the user can get on with their work, the processing can be done in the background and the user can see the results at their convenience.
Scalability
    By allowing some features of the platform to execute when resources become available at some point in the future, resources can be managed and scaled quickly. This allows the platform to handle more jobs using parallel processing.
Higher Limits
    Asynchronous processes are started in a new thread, with higher governor and execution limits. And to be honest, doesn’t everyone want higher governor and execution limits?
    Asynchronous Apex comes in a number of different flavors. We’ll get into more detail for each one shortly, but here’s a high level overview.

            Data cleansing or archiving of records.
          
          
            Queueable Apex
            Similar to future methods, but provide additional job chaining and allow more complex data types to be used.
            Performing sequential processing operations with external Web services.
          
          
            Scheduled Apex
            Schedule Apex to run at a specified time.
            Daily or weekly tasks.
          
        
      
    
    It’s also worth noting that these different types of asynchronous operations are not mutually exclusive. For instance, a common pattern is to kick off a Batch Apex job from a Scheduled Apex job.

    One of the main benefits of running asynchronous Apex is higher governor and execution limits. For example, the number of SOQL queries is doubled from 100 to 200 queries when using asynchronous calls. The total heap size and maximum CPU time are similarly larger for asynchronous calls.
    Not only do you get higher limits with async, but also those governor limits are independent of the limits in the synchronous request that queued the async request initially. That’s a mouthful, but essentially, you have two separate Apex invocations, and more than double the processing capability. This comes in handy for instances when you want to do as much processing as you can in the current transaction but when you start to get close to governor limits, continue asynchronously.
    If you enjoy reading about heap sizes, maximum execution times and limits in general, see Execution Governors and Limits  for compelling details.

    Asynchronous processing, in a multitenant environment, presents some challenges:
Ensure fairness of processing
    Make sure every customer gets a fair share of processing resources.
Ensure fault tolerance
    Make sure no asynchronous requests are lost due to equipment or software failures.The platform uses a queue-based asynchronous processing framework. This framework is used to manage asynchronous requests for multiple organizations within each instance. The request lifecycle is made up of three parts:
Enqueue
    The request gets put into the queue. This could be an Apex batch request, future Apex request or one of many others. The platform will enqueue requests along with the appropriate data to process that request.
Persistence
    The enqueued request is persisted. Requests are stored in persistent storage for failure recovery and to provide transactional capabilities.
Dequeue
    The enqueued request is removed from the queue and processed. If the processing fails, transaction control ensures that requests are not lost.Each request is processed by a handler. The handler is the code that performs functions for a specific request type. Handlers are executed by a finite number of worker threads on each of the application servers that make up an instance. The threads request work from the queuing framework and when received, start a specific handler to do the work.

    Asynchronous processing has lower priority than real-time interaction via the browser and API. To ensure there are sufficient resources to handle an increase in computing resources, the queuing framework monitors system resources such as server memory and CPU usage and reduce asynchronous processing when thresholds are exceeded. This is a fancy way of saying that the multitenant system protects itself. If an org tries to “gobble up” more than its share of resources, asynchronous processing is suspended until a normal threshold is reached. The long and short of it is that there’s no guarantee on processing time, but it’ll all work out in the end.

Z shell is a unix shell that extends Bourne shell functionality (also known as BASH shell) with improvements. Let’s learn more about the BASH shell.&nbsp;
BASH is an acronym that stands for bourne-again shell (bash). A clever play off the name of the predecessor shell, the Bourne shell (sh). Like the predecessor, BASH follows the language and syntax called the Shell Command Language as defined by POSIX. BASH comes with many features and functionalities. Z shell extends BASH functionality. Most developer tools, like npm, integrate with z shell seamlessly. This is why BASH (and now z shell) are the most commonly used shells in developer tutorials. There is also CSH (C Shell), a Unix shell, has a C-like programming syntax with built in arithmetics, and can also execute commands from a text file.
Each shell has its own syntax and capabilities that let them perform a variety of different tasks. If you don’t have ZSH, with a bit of searching, you can install these shells on your local machine. For now, let’s focus on PowerShell for Windows and ZSH for macOS and Linux.

Besides the difference in how the commands are written for each OS, the features and output of each shell also vary. Most notably, ZSH treats outputs as strings such as writing to .txt files. Whereas PowerShell treats the output as objects.
When the output is a string, it’s often easier for the user to transfer information across programs. This variable output becomes especially important when writing and running scripts or when working with APIs since those are typically in a .txt or format that supports strings. &nbsp;
The commands throughout this module are written for each OS using the default shells identified above. Next, we go over command structure and practice running commands&nbsp;

    Overview of Objects
  
  
    DreamHouse is a realty company that provides a way for customers to shop for homes and contact real estate agents online. DreamHouse brokers use some of Salesforce’s standard functionality, like contacts and leads, to track home buyers.
    But when it comes to selling houses, there are a lot more things they want to track. For example, Salesforce doesn’t include a standard way to track properties. How is DreamHouse supposed to know which homes they have for sale or how much each home costs?
    Luckily, the Salesforce admin, D’Angelo, knows that the Salesforce platform offers a solution. We’ll work with D’Angelo to see what he’s building.
    Let’s start with the data model. A data model is more or less what it sounds like. It’s a way to model what database tables look like in a way that makes sense to humans.
    If you’re not familiar with databases, think about storing data in a spreadsheet. For example, D’Angelo can use a spreadsheet to track all DreamHouse’s properties. Columns can store the address, cost, and other important attributes. Rows can store this information for each property that DreamHouse is selling. Database tables are set up in a similar way.
    
    But looking at data in tables isn’t ideal for humans. That’s where the data model comes in.
    In Salesforce, we think about database tables as objects, we think about columns as fields, and rows as records. So instead of an account spreadsheet or table, we have an Account object with fields and a bunch of identically structured records.
    
    When we talk about the data model, we’re talking about the collection of objects and fields in an app. Let’s learn more about objects and fields so you can start building your own data model.

    Salesforce supports several different types of objects. There are standard objects, custom objects, external objects, platform events, and BigObjects. In this module, we focus on the two most common types of objects: standard and custom.
    Standard objects are objects that are included with Salesforce. Common business objects like Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity are all standard objects.
    Custom objects are objects that you create to store information that’s specific to your company or industry. For DreamHouse, D’Angelo wants to build a custom Property object that stores information about the homes his company is selling.
    Objects are containers for your information, but they also give you special functionality. For example, when you create a custom object, the platform automatically builds things like the page layout for the user interface.

      Let’s work alongside D’Angelo to see how he builds the Property object. We need this object later, so don’t skip these steps!
    
    
      Scroll to the bottom of this page and create a trailhead playground. Don’t skip this step! You need to use a fresh and clean Trailhead Playground for this module.Note: Even if you're completing this module as part of the Admin Beginner trail, be sure and create a new Trailhead Playground to complete these steps. You don't need to reinstall the Dreamhouse app in the new playground org.
      Once your playground is created (it takes a minute!), press Launch.
      Click the gear icon &nbsp;at the top of the page and launch setup.
      Click the Object Manager tab.
      Click Create | Custom Object in the top-right corner.
      For Label, enter Property. Notice that the Object Name and Record Name fields auto-fill.
      For Plural Label, enter Properties.
      Prior to saving the custom object, scroll to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving this custom object.
      Leave the rest of the values as default and click Save.
      On the New Custom Object Tab page, click the Tab Style field and select a style you like. The style sets the icon to display in the UI for the object.
      Click Next, Next, and Save.
    
    
      Great job! You just created your first custom object. Now, let’s talk about adding fields to this object.

    Every standard and custom object has fields attached to it. Let’s get familiar with the different types of fields.
    
      
        
          
            
              Field Type
              What is it?
              Can I get an example?
            
          
          
            
              Identity
              A 15-character, case-sensitive field that’s automatically generated for every record. You can find a record’s ID in its URL.
              An account ID looks like 0015000000Gv7qJ.
            
            
              System
              Read-only fields that provide information about a record from the system, like when the record was created or when it was last changed.
              
CreatedDate, LastModifiedById, and LastModifiedDate.
            
            
              Name
              All records need names so you can distinguish between them. You can use text names or auto-numbered names that automatically increment every time you create a record.
              A contact’s name can be Julie Bean. A support case’s name can be CA-1024.
            
            
              Custom
              Fields you create on standard or custom objects are called custom fields.
              You can create a custom field on the Contact object to store your contacts’ birthdays.
            
          
        
      
    
    Identity, system, and name fields are standard on every object in Salesforce. Each standard object also comes with a set of prebuilt, standard fields. You can customize standard objects by adding custom fields, and you can add custom fields to your custom objects.
    Every field has a data type. A data type indicates what kind of information the field stores. Salesforce supports a bunch of different data types, but here are a few you’ll run into.
    
      
        
Checkbox—for fields that are a simple “yes” or “no,” a checkbox field is what you want.
        
Date or DateTime—these field types represent dates or date/time combinations, like birthdays or sales milestones.
        
Formula—this special field type holds a value that’s automatically calculated based on a formula that you write. For example, D’Angelo can write a formula field that automatically calculates a real estate agent’s commission on a home sale.
      
    
    Again, there are quite a few field types, but most of them are fairly self-explanatory. The important takeaway here is that you want to think about what kind of data you’re trying to store when you create a custom field.

      The Property object we just created is pretty bare-bones. Let’s add some custom fields to it. Head back to your Trailhead Playground.
    
    
      From Setup, go to Object Manager | Property.
      In the sidebar, click Fields &amp; Relationships. Notice that there are already some fields there. There’s a name field and some of the system fields we talked about earlier.
      Click New in the top right.
      For data type, select Currency.
      Click Next.
      Fill out the following:
          Field Label: Price

      Click Next, Next again, and then Save.
    
    
      You’ll see your new Price field in the list of Property fields. In the Field Name column, notice that it says Price__c. The “__c” part is an easy way to tell that a particular field is a custom field.

    While it can seem easy to add and customize objects, remember that what’s going on under the hood is technically complicated. Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you start customizing your own org.
    Be thoughtful about names. Once you start creating a bunch of objects, it can be tempting to give them “lazy” names. For example, if D’Angelo created another custom object to track condominiums, he might be tempted to name it “Property2” instead of “Condominium.” That’s a recipe for confusion in your org. Give your objects and fields descriptive, unique names to improve clarity.
    Help out your users. Even with careful naming, your users might not always be clear about the purpose of a particular object or field. Include descriptions for your custom objects and fields. For specialized or complicated customizations, use help text to give more details.
    Require fields when necessary. Sometimes, you’ll want to force your users to fill out a field when they’re creating a record on a certain object. Every property needs a price, right? Make important fields required to avoid incomplete data.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
        Name several uses for the Developer Console.
        Decide whether to use the Developer Console or a different developer tool.
        Set up workspaces to organize your tabs.
      An asteroid is hurtling toward your spaceship. You, as the commander of the spaceship, are responsible for your crew’s safety. Luckily, your ship is powered by Salesforce, so you have a handy console where you can monitor and program your systems as you prepare to take evasive action.
    Similarly, you can steer your company’s Salesforce org toward customer success using the Developer Console. So, here comes the first question that you likely have before taking the controls: What is the Developer Console?

    The Developer Console is an integrated development environment (more typically called an IDE) where you can create, debug, and test apps in your org.
    It’s your one-stop solution for a variety of development tasks.
        Navigate, open, create, and edit Apex classes and triggers, Aura components, and Visualforce pages and components.
        Browse packages that you’ve created in your org.
        Generate logs for debugging and analyze them using different perspectives.
        Test your Apex code to ensure that it’s error free.
        Identify and resolve errors by setting checkpoints in your Apex code.
        Write and execute SOQL and SOSL queries to find, create, and update the records in your org.
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  As of the Spring ‘19 release (API version 45.0), you can build Lightning components using two programming models: the Lightning Web Components model and the original Aura Components model. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page. This content covers Aura components. You can’t develop Lightning web components in the Developer Console.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        When Do You Use the Developer Console?
      
      Now that you’re in the cockpit, you’re probably looking at the different options available to control your Salesforce-powered spaceship. To control a Salesforce org, some of the options available to you are the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code, the Developer Console, and third-party developer tools like the ones that you can download from AppExchange.
      The Developer Console is connected to one org and is browser-based. If you want your changes to be effective immediately and you don’t want to install anything on your computer, we recommend the Developer Console. If you want to connect to multiple orgs, compare or synchronize files, or use version control, the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code is your best option.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The Developer Console doesn’t have version control or conflict resolution. To avoid overwriting other people’s code, be careful when you use the Developer Console in orgs that you share with your teammates.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Accessing the Developer Console
      
      
        The first thing you learn as a commander is how to access your console. After logging in to your org, click Developer Console under the quick access menu () or your name.
        
          
            
              
                Lightning Experience

        When you open the Developer Console for the first time, you see something like this.
        
        The main pane (1) is the source code editor, where you can write, view, and modify your code. The tabs pane (2) is where you can view logs, errors, and other information, and write queries to interact with the records in your org.

    After you’ve opened the Developer Console, the next step is to decide how to set up your workspace.
    
      
        What Is a Workspace?
      
      If your pit stops are on the Moon and Mars, you have a different set of system checks and flight paths for each location. It would be confusing and overwhelming to have information about landing on Mars in front of you while you maneuvered your spaceship toward the Moon. Similarly, workspaces in the Developer Console help you organize information to show just what you need as you work on each of your development tasks. Although it sounds like a fancy term, a workspace is simply a collection of resources, represented by tabs, in the main panel of the Developer Console. You can create a workspace for any group of resources that you use together.
      If you’re working on two different projects, you can have the related code, tests, and logs open simultaneously in separate workspaces. For instance, say you’re writing code to update some records for your engineering team, but you also want to check the system details for your navigation team. You can create two workspaces, each of which contains only the resources relevant to the project. Workspaces reduce clutter and make it easier to navigate between different resources.
      When you use the Developer Console for the first time, you see the default workspace. Setting up your own workspace is easy. Let’s try it out.
    
    
      
        Set Up Your Own Workspace
      
      
        Select Workspace | New Workspace and give your workspace a name. In your new workspace, you can create Apex classes, Aura components, Visualforce pages, and more.
        You can switch between your workspaces by selecting Workspace | Switch Workspace (1). In this way, you can work with code and analyze logs for each project just by opening a different workspace.
         Switch Workspace">

You don't need to ramp up on quirks of a particular framework. You simply create components using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Lightning web component creation is one, two, three steps. I'm not kidding. It's really that simple. You create (1) a JavaScript file, (2) an HTML file, and optionally (3) a CSS file.

Here's a very simple Lightning web component that displays “Hello World” in an input field.
HTML
&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;input value={message}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
The template tag is a fundamental building block of a component's HTML. It allows you to store pieces of HTML.
JavaScript
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
export default class App extends LightningElement {
  message = 'Hello World';
}Copy
We get into the import statement and class declaration details later, too.
CSS
input {
   color: blue;
}Copy
At minimum, all you really need is an HTML file and a JavaScript file with the same name in the same folder (also with a matching name). You deploy those to an org with some metadata and you're good to go. Salesforce compiles your files and takes care of the boilerplate component construction for you automatically.

    Introduction to Formula Fields
  
  
    You’ve got a lot of data in your organization. Your users need to access and understand this data at a glance without doing a bunch of calculations in their heads. Enter formula fields, the powerful tool that gives you control of how your data is displayed.
    Let’s say you wanted to take two numeric fields on a record and divide them to create a percentage. Or perhaps you want to turn a field into a clickable hyperlink for easy access to important information from a record’s page layout. Maybe you want to take two dates and calculate the number of days between them. All these things and more are possible using formula fields.
    Let’s look at a specific example. What if you wanted to calculate how many days are left until an opportunity’s close date? You can create a simple formula field that automatically calculates that value. By adding the value to the Opportunity page layout, your users can quickly access this key information. You can also add this field to reports and list views for instant access.
    
    When you’re first learning formulas, it’s best to start with simple calculations and build up to more complex scenarios. But even simple formulas can provide valuable information.
    In this unit, we take you through the basics of using the formula editor and introduce you to formula syntax through several basic examples. We also touch on troubleshooting problems with your formula fields. Now let’s have some fun!
    
      Ready to Get Hands-on with Formulas?
    
    Launch your Trailhead Playground now to follow along and try out the steps in this module. To open your Trailhead Playground, scroll down to the hands-on challenge and click Launch. You also use the playground when it’s time to complete the hands-on challenges.
    
      Find the Formula Editor
    
    
      
        Before we dive into writing formulas, let’s locate the formula editor and get to know its features.
        You can create custom formula fields on any standard or custom object. To start, we’ll create a formula on the Opportunity object. Follow these steps to navigate to the formula editor.
      
      
        From Setup, open the Object Manager and click Opportunity.
        In the left sidebar, click Fields &amp; Relationships.
        Click New.
        Select Formula and click Next.
        In Field Label, type My Formula Field. Notice that Field Name populates automatically.
        Select the type of data you expect your formula to return. For example, if you want to write a formula that calculates the commission a salesperson receives on a sale, you select Currency. For now, pick Text.
        Click Next. You’ve arrived at the formula editor! Time for our tour.

    This image highlights the most important parts of the formula editor.
      
        The formula editor comes in two flavors: Simple and Advanced. It’s tempting to use the Simple editor, but we always recommend using the Advanced editor. Advanced doesn’t mean more complicated. It means more tools for you to create powerful formulas.
        The Insert Field button opens a menu that allows you to select fields to use in your formula. Inserting from this menu automatically generates the correct syntax for accessing fields.&nbsp;

      Record detail pages contain a ton of information, but sometimes it’s not enough. Sometimes you need more! For your first formula, let’s do something simple. Let’s take a single field from an Account and show it on a Contact using what’s called a cross-object formula. Let’s take a look.
      First create a Contact. If you’ve never created a Contact before, click the App Launcher and select Contacts. Then go to the Contacts tab and click New. Enter any value for Last Name. For Account Name, enter an existing account such as United Oil &amp; Gas Corp. Click Save. Next we create a formula to display the account number on the Contact page.
      
        
          From Setup, open the Object Manager and click Contact.
          In the left sidebar click Fields &amp; Relationships.
          Click New.
          For the field type, select Formula and click Next.
          Call your field Account Number and select Text for the formula return type. Click Next.
          In the Advanced Formula Editor, click Insert Field. Select Contact | Account | Account Number and then click Insert. Click Check Syntax. If there are no syntax errors, click Next. It’s unlikely that you’ll find a syntax error in a simple formula like this one, but it's a good idea to get in the habit of checking syntax for every formula.

        Example 2: Display the Number of Days Until an Opportunity Closes on a Report
      
      You can also use formula fields in reports to increase the visibility of important information. Say, for example, you wanted a report column that displays the number of days until an opportunity is closed. First, create an Opportunity to test our formula.
      If you’ve never created an Opportunity before, click  and select Opportunities. go to the Opportunities tab and click New. Fill in any value for the Opportunity Name, select any Stage, and set a close date that’s at least 3 days in the future. Click Save.
      Then take these steps to create a custom formula field called Days to Close on the Opportunities object with a Number return type.
      
        
          From Setup, open the Object Manager and click Opportunity.
          In the left sidebar click Fields &amp; Relationships.
          Click New.
          Select Formula and then click Next.
          In the Field Label text area, type Days to Close.
          Select the Number radio button.
          Click Next to open the formula editor.
          To find the difference between the opportunity close date and today’s date subtract one from the other.&nbsp;
              Click Insert Field and select Opportunity | Close Date and click Insert.&nbsp;
              From the Insert Operator menu, select - Subtract.
            
          
          But how do we tell our formula that we need today’s date? Luckily, there’s a function called TODAY() that updates to match the current date.&nbsp;
              In the Functions menu on the right side of the editor, select TODAY.
              Click Insert Selected Function.&nbsp;
            
          
          Click Check Syntax. If there are no syntax errors, click Next.

        In the Add column... field on the left side of the page, enter Days to Close. &nbsp;This field is the formula field you just created. A column with the field containing the calculated value is automatically added to the report.
      
      You won't need the report again for this unit. You can discard it and move on to the next example.
      
        Example 3: Find Distinct Objects Using the Power of One
      
    
    
      Organizations often want to count the number of unique objects in a report with hundreds of records. Say, for example, you have a hundred opportunities listed in a report, but only a handful of users own all these opportunities. How do you find the number of distinct users? This task sounds difficult, but it’s one of the easiest formulas you can write. It’s called the Power of One.
      To write this formula, create a custom formula field on the User object. Name it Unique Users, give it a Number return type, and select 0 from the Decimal Places dropdown list. Click Next to open the formula editor. For this formula, you don’t need to insert any fields, operators, or functions. Instead, enter the number 1.
      
      Yes, that’s really it! Save your formula as usual, and then click the Reports tab to see it in action. Create an Opportunities report and make sure that Update Preview Automatically is enabled. In the Add column... field on the left side of the page, enter Unique Users to add a column with the new field to the report. You should see something similar to the following (your report may appear different, depending on what columns you have displayed).

Some pros say they add a Power of One field to every object in their org!

    Syntax errors are an inevitable part of working with formulas. The Check Syntax button in the editor is an important tool for debugging your formulas. The syntax checker tells you what error it encountered and where it’s located in your formula. Here are some common syntax issues.
    
      
        
Missing parentheses: This error most often occurs when the number of opening parentheses doesn’t match the number of closing parentheses. It can be particularly difficult to avoid this error if you’re using several functions at once. Try breaking your function into multiple lines so it’s easier to tell which sets of parentheses belong together. &nbsp; You’ll also see this error if you forget a comma between two function parameters. This error is confusing because the actual problem doesn’t match up with the syntax checker. If you’re certain your parentheses are correct, double check that the commas in your function are correct as well.

          Executing more advanced scenarios like&nbsp;sending requests to external systems or performing other longer running processes
          Benefit: Avoids slowing down or blocking the record update that triggered the flow
        
      
      
        
          Scheduled Paths

By default Apex classes have the ability to read and update all data within an organization. Therefore, it’s crucial that you enforce sharing rules, set object and field permissions, and protect against CRUD and FLS. Apex sharing rules are used to determine the “execution context” under which your code executes. You will need to determine which code should be run as “system mode”—that is, with access privileges to many resources—and which code should be run as “user mode,” in which the permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules of the current user are enforced.

2023-04-04 11:22:57,956 - INFO - Processed paragraph 7 in 0_secure-serverside-development_write-secure-apex-controllers_content.txt: Developers who use Apex need to ensure they don’t inadvertently expose sensitive data that would normally be hidden from users by user permissions, field-level security, or organization-wide defaults. Careful attention should be paid to web services that can be restricted by permissions but execute in system context once they are initiated.
Apex generally runs in system context. In system context, Apex code has access to all objects and fields—object permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules aren’t applied for the current user. This strategy ensures that code doesn’t fail to run because of hidden fields or objects for a user.
Sharing rules, however, aren’t always bypassed: The class must be declared with the without sharing keyword in order to ensure that sharing rules are not enforced. Most of the time, system context provides the correct behavior for system-level operations such as triggers and web services that need access to all data in an organization. However, you can also specify that particular Apex classes should enforce the sharing rules that apply to the current user.&nbsp;
There are three keywords to remember for sharing rules. You use the with sharing or without sharing keywords on a class to specify whether sharing rules must be enforced. You use the inherited sharing keyword on an Apex class to run the class in the sharing mode of the class that called it.
The only exception to the way Apex runs in system context, is Apex code executed with the executeAnonymous call and Chatter in Apex. The executeAnonymous call always executes using the full permissions of the current user.&nbsp;
With SharingThe with sharing keyword lets you specify that the sharing rules for the current user are considered for the class. You have to explicitly set this keyword for the class because Apex code runs in system context.&nbsp;
Without SharingYou use the without sharing keywords when declaring a class to ensure that the sharing rules for the current user are not enforced. For example, you can explicitly turn off sharing rule enforcement when a class is called from another class that is declared using with sharing.
Inherited Sharing
Apex without a sharing declaration is insecure by default. Designing Apex classes that can run in either with sharing or without sharing mode at runtime is an advanced technique. Such a technique can be difficult to distinguish from one where a specific sharing declaration is accidentally omitted. An explicit inherited sharing declaration makes the intent clear, avoiding ambiguity arising from an omitted declaration or false positives from security analysis tooling.
Using inherited sharing enables you to pass AppExchange Security Review and ensure that your privileged Apex code is not used in unexpected or insecure ways. An Apex class with inherited sharing runs as with sharing when used as:

You can also enforce object-level and field-level permissions in your code by explicitly calling the sObject describe result methods (of Schema.DescribeSObjectResult) and the field describe result methods (of Schema.DescribeFieldResult) that check the current user's access permission levels. In this way, you can verify if the current user has the necessary permission and only if they do, can you perform a specific DML operation or query.
For example, you can call the isAccessible, isCreateable, or isUpdateable methods of Schema.DescribeSObjectResult to verify whether the current user has read, create, or update access to an sObject, respectively. Similarly, Schema.DescribeFieldResult exposes these access control methods that you can call to check the current user's read, create, or update access for a field. In addition, you can call the isDeletable method provided by Schema.DescribeSObjectResult to check if the current user has permission to delete a specific sObject.
These are some examples of how to call the access control methods.

Field-Level Security
Field-level security (FLS) is configured similarly to CRUD but lets administrators define the profiles that can see and write to most fields of standard and custom objects.
You use the stripInaccessible method to enforce field- and object-level data protection. This method can be used to strip the fields and relationship fields from query and subquery results that the user can’t access. The method can also be used to remove inaccessible sObject fields before DML operations to avoid exceptions and to sanitize sObjects that have been deserialized from an untrusted source.
You access field- and object-level data protection through the Security and SObjectAccessDecision classes. The access check is based on the field-level permission of the current user in the context of the specified operation: create, read, update, or delete. The stripInaccessible method checks the source records for fields that don’t meet field-level security checks for the current user. The method also checks the source records for look up or master-detail relationship fields to which the current user doesn’t have access. The method creates a return list of sObjects that is identical to the source records, except that the fields that are inaccessible to the current user are removed. The sObjects returned by the getRecords method contain records in the same order as the sObjects in the sourceRecords parameter of the stripInaccessible method. Fields that aren’t queried are null in the return list, without causing an exception.

Every record in Salesforce is natively represented as an sObject in Apex. For example, the Acme account record corresponds to an Account sObject in Apex. The fields of the Acme record that you can view and modify in the user interface can be read and modified directly on the sObject as well.
    
    The following table lists some populated fields of the Acme account example record. The Account sObject is an abstraction of the account record and holds the account field information in memory as an object.
    
      
        Table 1. Account sObject for a Retrieved Record
        
          
            Account Field
            Value
          
        
        
          
            Id
            001D000000JlfXe
          
          
            Name
            Acme
          
          
            Phone
            (415)555-1212
          
          
            NumberOfEmployees
            100
          
        
      
    
    Each Salesforce record is represented as an sObject before it is inserted into Salesforce. Likewise, when persisted records are retrieved from Salesforce, they’re stored in an sObject variable.
    Standard and custom object records in Salesforce map to their sObject types in Apex. Here are some common sObject type names in Apex used for standard objects.
    
      Account
      Contact
      Lead
      Opportunity
    
    If you’ve added custom objects in your organization, use the API names of the custom objects in Apex. For example, a custom object called Merchandise corresponds to the Merchandise__c sObject in Apex.
    
      Create sObject Variables
      To create an sObject, you need to declare a variable and assign an sObject instance to it. The data type of the variable is the sObject type.
      The following example creates an sObject of type Account with the name Acme and assigns it to the acct variable.
      
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');Copy
      
    
    
      sObject and Field Names
      Apex references standard or custom sObjects and their fields using their unique API names.
      API names of object and fields can differ from their labels. For example, the Employees field has a label of Employees and appears on the account record page as Employees but its API name is NumberOfEmployees. To access this field in Apex, you’ll need to use the API name for the field: NumberOfEmployees.
      The following are highlights of some rules used for API names for custom objects and custom fields.
      For custom objects and custom fields, the API name always ends with the __c suffix. For custom relationship fields, the API name ends with the __r suffix. For example:
      
        A custom object with a label of Merchandise has an API name of Merchandise__c.
        A custom field with a label of Description has an API name of Description__c.
        A custom relationship field with a label of Items has an API name of Items__r.
      
      In addition, spaces in labels are replaced with underscores in API names. For example, a custom field name of Employee Seniority has an API name of Employee_Seniority__c.
    
    
      Find Object and Field Names
      To find out the names of standard objects and their fields for use in Apex, refer to the Object Reference for Salesforce and Lightning Platform.
      For both standard and custom objects, look up the object and field API names in your org. From Setup, click the Object Manager tab to the right of the Home tab, and then click your object’s name.
    
    
      Create sObjects and Adding Fields
      Before you can insert a Salesforce record, you must create it in memory first as an sObject. Like with any other object, sObjects are created with the new operator:
      
Account acct = new Account();Copy
      
      The API object name becomes the data type of the sObject variable in Apex. In this example, Account is the data type of the acct variable.
      The account referenced by the acct variable is empty because we haven’t populated any of its fields yet. There are two ways to add fields: through the constructor or by using dot notation.
      The fastest way to add fields is to specify them as name-value pairs inside the constructor. For example, this statement creates a new account sObject and populates its Name field with a string value.
      
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme');Copy
      
      The Name field is the only required field for accounts, which means that it has to be populated before being able to insert a new record. However, you can populate other fields as well for the new record. This example adds also a phone number and the number of employees.
      
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);Copy
      
      Alternatively, you can use the dot notation to add fields to an sObject. The following is equivalent to the previous example, although it takes a few more lines of code.
      
Account acct = new Account();
acct.Name = 'Acme';
acct.Phone = '(415)555-1212';
acct.NumberOfEmployees = 100;Copy

2023-04-04 11:25:46,509 - INFO - Processed paragraph 5 in 1_apex_database_apex_database_sobjects_content.txt: Work with the Generic sObject Data Type
  
  
    Typically, you use the specific sObject data type, such as Account for a standard object or Book__c for a custom object called Book, when working with sObjects. However, when you don’t know the type of sObject your method is handling, you can use the generic sObject data type.
    
      Variables that are declared with the generic sObject data type can reference any Salesforce record, whether it is a standard or custom object record.
      
        
      
      This example shows how any Salesforce object, such as an account or a custom object called Book__c, can be assigned to a generic sObject variable.
      
sObject sobj1 = new Account(Name='Trailhead');
sObject sobj2 = new Book__c(Name='Workbook 1');Copy
      
      In contrast, variables that are declared with the specific sObject data type can reference only the Salesforce records of the same type.
      
        
      
    
    
      Cast Generic sObjects to Specific sObject Types
      When you’re dealing with generic sObjects, you sometimes need to cast your sObject variable to a specific sObject type. One of the benefits of doing so is to be able to access fields using dot notation, which is not available on the generic sObject. Since sObject is a parent type for all specific sObject types, you can cast a generic sObject to a specific sObject. This example shows how to cast a generic sObject to Account.
      
// Cast a generic sObject to an Account
Account acct = (Account)myGenericSObject;
// Now, you can use the dot notation to access fields on Account
String name = acct.Name;
String phone = acct.Phone;Copy
      
    
    
      
        Tell Me More...
      
      The fields of a generic sObject can be accessed only through the put() and get() methods.
      In this unit, you’ve learned what sObjects are and how to use them. However, creating an sObject doesn’t persist it as a record in the database. To save the sObject as a record, and do other things with it, use the Data Manipulation Language (DML). To retrieve a record, use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL). Check out later units to learn about DML and SOQL.

    Before deploying a trigger, write unit tests to perform the actions that fire the trigger and verify expected results.
    Let’s test a trigger that we worked with in the Apex Triggers module. If an account record has related opportunities, the AccountDeletion trigger prevents the record’s deletion.
    
      
        Prerequisites
      
      
        If you haven’t yet added the AccountDeletiontrigger, follow these steps.
            In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Trigger.
            Enter AccountDeletion for the trigger name, and then select Account for the sObject. Click Submit.
            Replace the default code with the following.trigger AccountDeletion on Account (before delete) {
    // Prevent the deletion of accounts if they have related opportunities.
    for (Account a : [SELECT Id FROM Account
                     WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity) AND
                     Id IN :Trigger.old]) {
        Trigger.oldMap.get(a.Id).addError(
            'Cannot delete account with related opportunities.');
    }
}Copy
            
          
        
        If you added the AccountDeletiontrigger in a previous unit but disabled it so that the system could check your challenge, re-enable it.
            From Setup, search for Apex Triggers.
            On the Apex Triggers page, click Edit next to the AccountDeletion trigger.
            Select Is Active.
            Click Save.
          
        
        If your org contains triggers from a previous unit called AddRelatedRecord, CalloutTrigger, or HelloWorldTrigger, disable them. For example, to disable the AddRelatedRecordtrigger:
            From Setup, search for Apex Triggers.
            On the Apex Triggers page, click Edit next to the AddRelatedRecord trigger.
            Deselect Is Active.
            Click Save.
          
        
        To disable the HelloWorldTrigger and CalloutTrigger triggers, repeat the previous steps.
      
    
    
      
        Add and Run a Unit Test
      
      First, let’s start by adding a test method. This test method verifies what the trigger is designed to do (the positive case): preventing an account from being deleted if it has related opportunities.
      
        In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Class.
        Enter TestAccountDeletion for the class name, and then click OK.
        Replace the default class body with the following.@isTest
private class TestAccountDeletion {
    @isTest static void TestDeleteAccountWithOneOpportunity() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create an account with an opportunity, and then try to delete it
        Account acct = new Account(Name='Test Account');
        insert acct;
        Opportunity opp = new Opportunity(Name=acct.Name + ' Opportunity',
                                       StageName='Prospecting',
                                       CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                       AccountId=acct.Id);
        insert opp;
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult result = Database.delete(acct, false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Verify 
        // In this case the deletion should have been stopped by the trigger,
        // so verify that we got back an error.
        System.assert(!result.isSuccess());
        System.assert(result.getErrors().size() &gt; 0);
        System.assertEquals('Cannot delete account with related opportunities.',
                             result.getErrors()[0].getMessage());
    }
}CopyThe test method first sets up a test account with an opportunity. Next, it deletes the test account, which fires the AccountDeletion trigger. The test method verifies that the trigger prevented the deletion of the test account by checking the return value of the Database.delete() call. The return value is a Database.DeleteResult object that contains information about the delete operation. The test method verifies that the deletion was not successful and verifies the error message obtained.
        To run this test, click Test | New Run.
        Under Test Classes, click TestAccountDeletion.
        To add all the methods in the TestAccountDeletion class to the test run, click Add Selected.
        Click Run. Find the test result in the Tests tab under the latest run.
      
      The TestAccountDeletion test class contains only one test method, which tests for a single account record. Also, this test is for the positive case. Always test for more scenarios to ensure that the trigger works in all cases, including deleting an account without opportunities and bulk account deletions.
      Test data is set up inside the test method, which can be time-consuming as you add more test methods. If you have many test methods, put test-data creation in a test utility class and call the utility class from multiple test methods. The next unit shows you how to take advantage of a test utility class and add more test methods.
    
    
      
        Tell Me More
      
      The test method contains the Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() method pair, which delimits a block of code that gets a fresh set of governor limits. In this test, test-data setup uses two DML statements before the test is performed. To test that Apex code runs within governor limits, isolate data setup’s limit usage from your test’s. To isolate the data setup process’s limit usage, enclose the test call within the Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() block. Also use this test block when testing asynchronous Apex. For more information, see Using Limits, startTest, and stopTest.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  A known issue with the Developer Console prevents it from updating code coverage correctly when running a subset of tests. To update your code coverage results, use Test | Run All rather than Test | New Run.

2023-04-04 11:28:00,017 - INFO - Processed paragraph 2 in 1_apex_triggers_apex_triggers_bulk_content.txt: Bulk Trigger Design Patterns
  
  
    Apex triggers are optimized to operate in bulk. We recommend using bulk design patterns for processing records in triggers. When you use bulk design patterns, your triggers have better performance, consume less server resources, and are less likely to exceed platform limits.
    
      The benefit of bulkifying your code is that bulkified code can process large numbers of records efficiently and run within governor limits on the Lightning Platform. These governor limits are in place to ensure that runaway code doesn’t monopolize resources on the multitenant platform.
      The following sections demonstrate the main ways of bulkifying your Apex code in triggers: operating on all records in the trigger, and performing SOQL and DML on collections of sObjects instead of single sObjects at a time. The SOQL and DML bulk best practices apply to any Apex code, including SOQL and DML in classes. The examples given are based on triggers and use the Trigger.new context variable.
    
    
      
        Operating on Record Sets
      
      Let’s first look at the most basic bulk design concept in triggers. Bulkified triggers operate on all sObjects in the trigger context. Typically, triggers operate on one record if the action that fired the trigger originates from the user interface. But if the origin of the action was bulk DML or the API, the trigger operates on a record set rather than one record. For example, when you import many records via the API, triggers operate on the full record set. Therefore, a good programming practice is to always assume that the trigger operates on a collection of records so that it works in all circumstances.
      The following trigger assumes that only one record caused the trigger to fire. This trigger doesn’t work on a full record set when multiple records are inserted in the same transaction. A bulkified version is shown in the next example.
      trigger MyTriggerNotBulk on Account(before insert) {
    Account a = Trigger.new[0];
    a.Description = 'New description';
}Copy
      
      This example is a modified version of MyTrigger. It uses a for loop to iterate over all available sObjects. This loop works if Trigger.new contains one sObject or many sObjects.
      trigger MyTriggerBulk on Account(before insert) {
    for(Account a : Trigger.new) {
        a.Description = 'New description';
    }
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Performing Bulk SOQL
      
      SOQL queries can be powerful. You can retrieve related records and check a combination of multiple conditions in one query. By using SOQL features, you can write less code and make fewer queries to the database. Making fewer database queries helps you avoid hitting query limits, which are 100 SOQL queries for synchronous Apex or 200 for asynchronous Apex.
      The following trigger shows a SOQL query pattern to avoid. The example makes a SOQL query inside a for loop to get the related opportunities for each account, which runs once for each Account sObject in Trigger.new. If you have a large list of accounts, a SOQL query inside a for loop could result in too many SOQL queries. The next example shows the recommended approach.
      trigger SoqlTriggerNotBulk on Account(after update) {   
    for(Account a : Trigger.new) {
        // Get child records for each account
        // Inefficient SOQL query as it runs once for each account!
        Opportunity[] opps = [SELECT Id,Name,CloseDate 
                             FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId=:a.Id];
        // Do some other processing
    }
}Copy
      
      This example is a modified version of the previous one and shows a best practice for running SOQL queries. The SOQL query does the heavy lifting and is called once outside the main loop.
      
        The SOQL query uses an inner query—(SELECT Id FROM Opportunities)—to get related opportunities of accounts.
        The SOQL query is connected to the trigger context records by using the IN clause and binding the Trigger.new variable in the WHERE clause—WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new. This WHERE condition filters the accounts to only those records that fired this trigger.
      
      Combining the two parts in the query results in the records we want in one call: the accounts in this trigger with the related opportunities of each account.
      After the records and their related records are obtained, the for loop iterates over the records of interest by using the collection variable—in this case, acctsWithOpps. The collection variable holds the results of the SOQL query. That way, the for loop iterates only over the records we want to operate on. Because the related records are already obtained, no further queries are needed within the loop to get those records.
      trigger SoqlTriggerBulk on Account(after update) {  
    // Perform SOQL query once.    
    // Get the accounts and their related opportunities.
    List&lt;Account&gt; acctsWithOpps = 
        [SELECT Id,(SELECT Id,Name,CloseDate FROM Opportunities) 
         FROM Account WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new];
    // Iterate over the returned accounts    
    for(Account a : acctsWithOpps) { 
        Opportunity[] relatedOpps = a.Opportunities;  
        // Do some other processing
    }
}Copy
      
      Alternatively, if you don’t need the account parent records, you can retrieve only the opportunities that are related to the accounts within this trigger context. This list is specified in the WHERE clause by matching the AccountId field of the opportunity to the ID of accounts in Trigger.new: WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new. The returned opportunities are for all accounts in this trigger context and not for a specific account. This next example shows the query used to get all related opportunities.
      trigger SoqlTriggerBulk on Account(after update) {  
    // Perform SOQL query once.    
    // Get the related opportunities for the accounts in this trigger.
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; relatedOpps = [SELECT Id,Name,CloseDate FROM Opportunity
        WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new];
    // Iterate over the related opportunities    
    for(Opportunity opp : relatedOpps) { 
        // Do some other processing
    }
}Copy
      
      You can reduce the previous example in size by combining the SOQL query with the for loop in one statement: the SOQL for loop. Here is another version of this bulk trigger using a SOQL for loop.
      trigger SoqlTriggerBulk on Account(after update) {  
    // Perform SOQL query once.    
    // Get the related opportunities for the accounts in this trigger,
    // and iterate over those records.
    for(Opportunity opp : [SELECT Id,Name,CloseDate FROM Opportunity
        WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new]) {
        // Do some other processing
    }
}Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                      
                        
                          Triggers execute on batches of 200 records at a time. So if 400 records cause a trigger to fire, the trigger fires twice, once for each 200 records. For this reason, you don’t get the benefit of SOQL for loop record batching in triggers, because triggers batch up records as well. The SOQL for loop is called twice in this example, but a standalone SOQL query would also be called twice. However, the SOQL for loop still looks more elegant than iterating over a collection variable!
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Performing Bulk DML
      
    
    
      When performing DML calls in a trigger or in a class, perform DML calls on a collection of sObjects when possible. Performing DML on each sObject individually uses resources inefficiently. The Apex runtime allows up to 150 DML calls in one transaction.
      This trigger performs an update call inside a for loop that iterates over related opportunities. If certain conditions are met, the trigger updates the opportunity description. In this example, the update statement is inefficiently called once for each opportunity. If a bulk account update operation fired the trigger, there can be many accounts. If each account has one or two opportunities, we can easily end up with over 150 opportunities. The DML statement limit is 150 calls.
      trigger DmlTriggerNotBulk on Account(after update) {   
    // Get the related opportunities for the accounts in this trigger.        
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; relatedOpps = [SELECT Id,Name,Probability FROM Opportunity
        WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new];          
    // Iterate over the related opportunities
    for(Opportunity opp : relatedOpps) {      
        // Update the description when probability is greater 
        // than 50% but less than 100% 
        if ((opp.Probability &gt;= 50) &amp;&amp; (opp.Probability &lt; 100)) {
            opp.Description = 'New description for opportunity.';
            // Update once for each opportunity -- not efficient!
            update opp;
        }
    }    
}Copy
      
      This next example shows how to perform DML in bulk efficiently with only one DML call on a list of opportunities. The example adds the Opportunity sObject to update to a list of opportunities (oppsToUpdate) in the loop. Next, the trigger performs the DML call outside the loop on this list after all opportunities have been added to the list. This pattern uses only one DML call regardless of the number of sObjects being updated.
      trigger DmlTriggerBulk on Account(after update) {   
    // Get the related opportunities for the accounts in this trigger.        
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; relatedOpps = [SELECT Id,Name,Probability FROM Opportunity
        WHERE AccountId IN :Trigger.new];
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; oppsToUpdate = new List&lt;Opportunity&gt;();
    // Iterate over the related opportunities
    for(Opportunity opp : relatedOpps) {      
        // Update the description when probability is greater 
        // than 50% but less than 100% 
        if ((opp.Probability &gt;= 50) &amp;&amp; (opp.Probability &lt; 100)) {
            opp.Description = 'New description for opportunity.';
            oppsToUpdate.add(opp);
        }
    }
    // Perform DML on a collection
    update oppsToUpdate;
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Bulk Design Pattern in Action: Example of Getting Related Records
      
      Let’s apply the design patterns you’ve learned by writing a trigger that accesses accounts’ related opportunities. Modify the trigger example from the previous unit for the AddRelatedRecord trigger. The AddRelatedRecord trigger operates in bulk, but the one from the previous unit isn’t as efficient as it could be because it iterates over all Trigger.New&nbsp;sObject records. This next example modifies both the trigger code and the SOQL query to get only the records of interest and then iterate over those records. If you haven’t created this trigger, don’t worry—you can create it in this section.
      Let’s start by reviewing the requirements for the AddRelatedRecord trigger. The trigger fires after accounts are inserted or updated. The trigger adds a default opportunity for every account that doesn’t already have an opportunity.&nbsp;
      First of all, newly-inserted accounts never have a default opportunity, so we definitely need to add one. But for updated accounts, we need to determine whether they have a related opportunity or not. So let’s separate how we process inserts and updates by using a switch statement on the Trigger.operationType context variable. And then keep track of the accounts we need to process with a toProcess variable. For example:
      List&lt;Account&gt; toProcess = null;
switch on Trigger.operationType {
    when AFTER_INSERT {
        // do stuff
    }
    when AFTER_UPDATE {
        // do stuff
    }
}Copy
      
      For all account inserts, we simply assign the new accounts to the toProcess list:
    
    when AFTER_INSERT {
     toProcess = Trigger.New;
}Copy
    
    
      For updates, we must figure out which existing accounts in this trigger don’t already have a related opportunity. Because this trigger is an after trigger, we can query the affected records from the database. Here’s the SOQL statement, the results of which we assign to the toProcess list.
    
    when AFTER_UPDATE {
     toProcess = [SELECT Id,Name FROM Account
                  WHERE Id IN :Trigger.New AND
                  Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId in :Trigger.New)];
}Copy
    
    
      
      We now use a for loop to iterate through the toProcess list of accounts and add a related default opportunity to oppList. When we’re finished, we bulk add the list of opportunities using the insert DML statement. &nbsp;Here’s how to create or update the complete trigger.
      
        If you’ve already created the AddRelatedRecord trigger in the previous unit, modify the trigger by replacing its contents with the following trigger. Otherwise, add the following trigger using the Developer Console and enter AddRelatedRecordfor the trigger name.
          trigger AddRelatedRecord on Account(after insert, after update) {
    List&lt;Opportunity&gt; oppList = new List&lt;Opportunity&gt;();
    // Add an opportunity for each account if it doesn't already have one.
    // Iterate over accounts that are in this trigger but that don't have opportunities.
    List&lt;Account&gt; toProcess = null;
    switch on Trigger.operationType {
        when AFTER_INSERT {
        // All inserted Accounts will need the Opportunity, so there is no need to perform the query
            toProcess = Trigger.New;
        }
        when AFTER_UPDATE {
            toProcess = [SELECT Id,Name FROM Account
                         WHERE Id IN :Trigger.New AND
                         Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId in :Trigger.New)];
        }
    }
    for (Account a : toProcess) {
        // Add a default opportunity for this account
        oppList.add(new Opportunity(Name=a.Name + ' Opportunity',
                                    StageName='Prospecting',
                                    CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                    AccountId=a.Id));
    }
    if (oppList.size() &gt; 0) {
        insert oppList;
    }
}Copy
          
        
        To test the trigger, create an account in the Salesforce user interface and name it Lions &amp; Cats.
        In the Opportunities related list on the account’s page, find the new opportunity Lions &amp; Cats. The trigger added the opportunity automatically!

    Future Apex
  
  
    Future Apex is used to run processes in a separate thread, at a later time when system resources become available.
    Note: Technically, you use the @future annotation to identify methods that run asynchronously. However, because "methods identified with the @future annotation" is laborious, they are commonly referred to as "future methods" and that’s how we’ll reference them for the remainder of this module.
    When using synchronous processing, all method calls are made from the same thread that is executing the Apex code, and no additional processing can occur until the process is complete. You can use future methods for any operation you’d like to run asynchronously in its own thread. This provides the benefits of not blocking the user from performing other operations and providing higher governor and execution limits for the process. Everyone’s a winner with asynchronous processing.
    Future methods are typically used for: 
      
        Callouts to external Web services. If you are making callouts from a trigger or after performing a DML operation, you must use a future or queueable method. A callout in a trigger would hold the database connection open for the lifetime of the callout and that is a "no-no" in a multitenant environment.
        Operations you want to run in their own thread, when time permits such as some sort of resource-intensive calculation or processing of records.
        Isolating DML operations on different sObject types to prevent the mixed DML error. This is somewhat of an edge-case but you may occasionally run across this issue. See sObjects That Cannot Be Used Together in DML Operations for more details.

    Future methods must be static methods, and can only return a void type. The specified parameters must be primitive data types, arrays of primitive data types, or collections of primitive data types. Notably, future methods can’t take standard or custom objects as arguments. A common pattern is to pass the method a List of record IDs that you want to process asynchronously.
    
public class SomeClass {
  @future
  public static void someFutureMethod(List&lt;Id&gt; recordIds) {
    List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = [Select Id, Name from Account Where Id IN :recordIds];
    // process account records to do awesome stuff
  }
}Copy
    
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                The reason why objects can’t be passed as arguments to future methods is because the object can change between the time you call the method and the time that it actually executes. Remember, future methods are executed when system resources become available. In this case, the future method may have an old object value when it actually executes, which can cause all sorts of bad things to happen.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    It’s important to note that future methods are not guaranteed to execute in the same order as they are called. We'll say it again, because it's crucial for you to remember: future methods are not guaranteed to execute in the same order as they are called. When using future methods, it’s also possible that two future methods could run concurrently, which could result in record locking and a nasty runtime error if the two methods were updating the same record.
    
      
        Sample Callout Code
      
      To make a Web service callout to an external service or API, you create an Apex class with a future method that is marked with (callout=true). The class below has methods for making the callout both synchronously and asynchronously where callouts are not permitted. We insert a record into a custom log object to track the status of the callout simply because logging is always fun to do!
      
public class SMSUtils {
    // Call async from triggers, etc, where callouts are not permitted.
    @future(callout=true)
    public static void sendSMSAsync(String fromNbr, String toNbr, String m) {
        String results = sendSMS(fromNbr, toNbr, m);
        System.debug(results);
    }
    // Call from controllers, etc, for immediate processing
    public static String sendSMS(String fromNbr, String toNbr, String m) {
        // Calling 'send' will result in a callout
        String results = SmsMessage.send(fromNbr, toNbr, m);
        insert new SMS_Log__c(to__c=toNbr, from__c=fromNbr, msg__c=results);
        return results;
    }

    Testing future methods is a little different than typical Apex testing. To test future methods, enclose your test code between the startTest() and stopTest() test methods. The system collects all asynchronous calls made after the startTest(). When stopTest() is executed, all these collected asynchronous processes are then run synchronously. You can then assert that the asynchronous call operated properly.
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Test code cannot actually send callouts to external systems, so you’ll have to ‘mock’ the callout for test coverage. Check out the Apex Integration Services module for complete details on mocking callouts for testing.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    Here’s our mock callout class used for testing. The Apex testing framework utilizes this ‘mock’ response instead of making the actual callout to the REST API endpoint.
    
@isTest
public class SMSCalloutMock implements HttpCalloutMock {
    public HttpResponse respond(HttpRequest req) {
        // Create a fake response
        HttpResponse res = new HttpResponse();
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        res.setBody('{"status":"success"}');
        res.setStatusCode(200);
        return res;
    }
}Copy
    
    The test class contains a single test method (testSendSms() in this example), which tests both the asynchronous and synchronous methods as the former calls the latter.
    
@IsTest
private class Test_SMSUtils {
  @IsTest
  private static void testSendSms() {
    Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new SMSCalloutMock());
    Test.startTest();
      SMSUtils.sendSMSAsync('111', '222', 'Greetings!');
    Test.stopTest();
    // runs callout and check results
    List&lt;SMS_Log__c&gt; logs = [select msg__c from SMS_Log__c];
    System.assertEquals(1, logs.size());
    System.assertEquals('success', logs[0].msg__c);
  }

    Because every future method invocation adds one request to the asynchronous queue, avoid design patterns that add large numbers of future requests over a short period of time. If your design has the potential to add 2000 or more requests at a time, requests could get delayed due to flow control. Here are some best practices you want to keep in mind: 
      
        Ensure that future methods execute as fast as possible.
        If using Web service callouts, try to bundle all callouts together from the same future method, rather than using a separate future method for each callout.
        Conduct thorough testing at scale. Test that a trigger enqueuing the @future calls is able to handle a trigger collection of 200 records. This helps determine if delays may occur given the design at current and future volumes.
        Consider using Batch Apex instead of future methods to process large number of records asynchronously. This is more efficient than creating a future request for each record.

    Future methods are a great tool, but with great power comes great responsibility. Here are some things to keep in mind when using them: 
      
        Methods with the @future annotation must be static methods, and can only return a void type.
        The specified parameters must be primitive data types, arrays of primitive data types, or collections of primitive data types; future methods can’t take objects as arguments.
        Future methods won’t necessarily execute in the same order they are called. In addition, it’s possible that two future methods could run concurrently, which could result in record locking if the two methods were updating the same record.
        Future methods can’t be used in Visualforce controllers in getMethodName(), setMethodName(), nor in the constructor.
        You can’t call a future method from a future method. Nor can you invoke a trigger that calls a future method while running a future method. See the link in the Resources for preventing recursive future method calls.
        The getContent() and getContentAsPDF() methods can’t be used in methods with the @future annotation.
        You’re limited to 50 future calls per Apex invocation, and there’s an additional limit on the number of calls in a 24-hour period. For more information on limits, see the link below.

Flag. Flags (sometimes called options) specify a value that triggers a process or tells the command what other variables to include. Most values in flags are Boolean (true or false) or tell the system you want to set a variable such as naming a project. 
    Flags are identified by one hyphen - and followed by a value. Some commands may have required flags. Some flags may require arguments. For example, when creating a new sfdx project, if you want to name your project, you use the -n flag and then add the name of your project as the argument -n MyProject.   Switches are a lot like flags but don't require arguments. Switches are identified by two hyphens -- and followed by a value. 
    For example, let's take a look at the Salesforce CLI sfdx force:org:create command and use the switch that sets the scratch org as your default. Instead of using the flag -s, you use the switch --setdefault. By using this switch when you create a scratch org, the system remembers your username and authentication so you don't have to include your username in commands later on. For Salesforce CLI commands, we've baked in a lot of flag options as switches to simplify working in the command-line tool.   
    
  
  
Arguments. Arguments tell the system what variable you want to set or which process you want to invoke. Arguments usually follow a flag after a space.   Example: -n MyProject

Depending on what commands you're running, some flags and arguments can change the outcome of your project.

Flags: The remaining part of the command has two flags. 
      The first flag -f is a required flag. This flag tells the system to reference the filename that outlines what template to reference to create the scratch org.
      The second flag -s sets the newly created scratch org as the default. This flag does not require an argument because you can also write this flag as a switch --setdefaultusername. This flag tells the system to remember your username so when you run commands for this scratch org later (such as when you push or pull metadata), you won't have to enter the username or an alias because you've set the scratch org as your default using the -s flag.
    
  
  
Argument: The file's name being referenced, project-scratch-def.json is the argument in this command. This file determines what features and special org set up (if any) is needed for this new scratch org.

    What Are Object Relationships?
  
  Now that we’re comfortable with objects and fields, it’s time to take things to the next level with object relationships. Object relationships are a special field type that connects two objects together.
  
    Let’s think about a standard object like Account. If a sales rep opens an account, they’ve probably been talking to a few people at that account’s company. They’ve probably made contacts like executives or IT managers and stored those contacts’ information in Salesforce.
    It makes sense, then, that there should be a relationship between the Account object and the Contact object. And there is!
    When you look at an account record in Salesforce, you can see that there’s a section for contacts on the Related tab. You can also see that there’s a button that lets you quickly add a contact to an account.
    
    The Account to Contact relationship is an example of a standard relationship in Salesforce. But just like objects and fields, you can build custom relationships as well. In the last unit, you created two objects: Property and Offer. Wouldn’t it be great if all the offers made on a home showed up on its record in Salesforce?
    Before we do that, let’s talk about the different kinds of relationships you can create in Salesforce.

    There are two main types of object relationships: lookup and master-detail.
    
      Lookup Relationships
      In our Account to Contact example above, the relationship between the two objects is a lookup relationship. A lookup relationship essentially links two objects together so that you can “look up” one object from the related items on another object.
      Lookup relationships can be one-to-one or one-to-many. The Account to Contact relationship is one-to-many because a single account can have many related contacts. For our DreamHouse scenario, you could create a one-to-one relationship between the Property object and a Home Seller object.
    
    
      Master-Detail Relationships
      
        While lookup relationships are fairly casual, master-detail relationships are a bit tighter. In this type of relationship, one object is the master and another is the detail. The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, like who can view the detail’s data.
        For example, let’s say the owner of a property wanted to take their home off the market. DreamHouse wouldn’t want to keep any offers made on that property. With a master-detail relationship between Property and Offer, you can delete the property and all its associated offers from your system.
        
      
    
    
      More on Relationships
      Just like in real life, relationships are complicated. Here’s a bit more information to help you differentiate between lookup and master-detail relationships.
      Typically, you use lookup relationships when objects are only related in some cases. Sometimes a contact is associated with a specific account, but sometimes it’s just a contact. Objects in lookup relationships usually work as stand-alone objects and have their own tabs in the user interface.
      In a master-detail relationship, the detail object doesn’t work as a stand-alone. It’s highly dependent on the master. In fact, if a record on the master object is deleted, all its related detail records are deleted as well. When you’re creating master-detail relationships, you always create the relationship field on the detail object.
      Finally, you could run into a third relationship type called a hierarchical relationship. Hierarchical relationships are a special type of lookup relationship. The main difference between the two is that hierarchical relationships are only available on the User object. You can use them for things like creating management chains between users.
      When you start adding relationships between objects, remember that you’re increasing the complexity of your data model. That’s not a bad thing, but be extra cautious when you do things like change and delete objects, records, or fields. Check out the resources section for more information on relationship behaviors.

      We’re going to create two custom relationship fields on the Favorite object. First, let’s create a lookup relationship that lists the users who select Favorite for a property.
    
    
      From Setup, go to Object Manager | Favorite.
      On the sidebar, click Fields &amp; Relationships.
      Click New.
      Choose Lookup Relationship and click Next.
      For Related To, choose Contact. For the purposes of DreamHouse, contacts represent potential home buyers.
      Click Next.
      For Field Name, enter Contact, then click Next.

      Now, we’re going to create a second relationship field. We want a master-detail relationship where Property is the master and Favorite is the detail.
    
    
      On the Object Manager page for the custom object, click Fields &amp; Relationships.
      Click New.
      Select Master-Detail Relationship and click Next.
      For Related To, choose Property.
      Click Next.
      For Field Name, enter Property and click Next.
      Click Next, Next, and Save.
    Now, if you look at a Property record, you’ll see Favorites listed in the related tab.
    
      Add a Favorite Property
    
    Let's take a look at how to view favorite properties.
    
      From the App Launcher ( in the navigation bar), find and select Sales.
      Click the Properties tab in the navigation bar. If you don’t see it, look under the More dropdown.
      Click the name of a Property record.
      Click Related. You’ll see Favorites (0) in the related tab.
      Click New.
      Enter a name for Favorite Name, then click Save.
    
    
      Great job! Our Favorite object is all set up.

    Now that you’ve started to get comfortable with the Developer Console, let’s use it to view, modify, and run the systems powering your spaceship. In other words, let’s get cracking with some code!
    
      
        Create an Apex Class
      
      Apex is a Salesforce programming language that you can use to customize business processes in your org. If you like fancy words, you might call Apex a strongly typed, object-oriented language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction-control statements on the Lightning Platform server, in conjunction with calls to the Lightning Platform APIs. Or you can just call it a programming language that looks a lot like Java code and interacts with the data in your org. You use it to add business logic. For example, if you want to alert an account owner when contact information changes, Apex is the answer.
      To learn more about Apex and how it works, check out the Apex Basics &amp; Database module. For now, don’t worry too much about the code—our goal is to get to know the Developer Console.
      Say you need to change your flight path to avoid asteroid 2014 QO441. You don’t have time to contact the ground control team to tell them about your course correction. Let’s write some Apex code that sends an email to your Mission Specialist on Earth every time you change your flight path.
      
        
          In the Developer Console, select File | New | Apex Class.
          When prompted, name your Apex class EmailMissionSpecialist.
          When the text editor opens, copy and paste the following code into the EmailMissionSpecialist.apxc tab, replacing the tab’s original contents.public class EmailMissionSpecialist {
   // Public method
   public void sendMail(String address, String subject, String body) {
      // Create an email message object
      Messaging.SingleEmailMessage mail = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
      String[] toAddresses = new String[] {address};
      mail.setToAddresses(toAddresses);
      mail.setSubject(subject);
      mail.setPlainTextBody(body);
      // Pass this email message to the built-in sendEmail method 
      // of the Messaging class
      Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results = Messaging.sendEmail(
                                new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[] { mail });
      // Call a helper method to inspect the returned results
      inspectResults(results);
   }
   // Helper method
   private static Boolean inspectResults(Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results) {
      Boolean sendResult = true;
      // sendEmail returns an array of result objects.
      // Iterate through the list to inspect results. 
      // In this class, the methods send only one email, 
      // so we should have only one result.
      for (Messaging.SendEmailResult res : results) {
         if (res.isSuccess()) {
            System.debug('Email sent successfully');
         }
         else {
            sendResult = false;
            System.debug('The following errors occurred: ' + res.getErrors());                 
         }
      }
      return sendResult;
   }
}Copy
          
          Save your code using File | Save. The Developer Console checks to make sure that your code doesn’t contain any errors when you save it.Note: If your code isn’t syntactically correct, an error shows up in the Problems tab. You can use the error details to correct your code.
        
      
      If you close this window, you can use the console to open this class or any other saved Apex class. Let’s try that now.
          To close the EmailMissionSpecialist&nbsp;class, click the ‘X’ next to EmailMissionSpecialist.apxc, at the top of the tab.
          Select File | Open.
          In the Entity Type column, click Classes.

        Execute an Apex Class
      
      Now that you’ve created your Apex class, your next step is to execute it using the Developer Console’s handy Execute Anonymous feature. This feature is a useful tool when you want to test your code and its results.
      But you have to be careful. All code that you run using this feature affects your org. For instance, if you delete data here, it’s also deleted in your database.
      
        
          Select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window. The Enter Apex Code window opens.
          Copy the following code and paste it into the Enter Apex Code window. EmailMissionSpecialist em = new EmailMissionSpecialist();
em.sendMail('Enter your email address', 'Flight Path Change', 
   'Mission Control 123: Your flight path has been changed to avoid collision '
   + 'with asteroid 2014 QO441.');Copy
          
          Replace Enter your email address&nbsp;with your email address.
          Click Execute, and then check your email to see whether the message was sent successfully.
        
      
      When you receive the email, you know that the communication systems are in working order—and that you’re one step closer to being ready to avoid that asteroid.

      Lightning Components is a framework for developing mobile and desktop apps. You can use it to create responsive user interfaces for Lightning Platform apps. Lightning components also make it easier to build apps that work well across mobile and desktop devices.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  As of the Spring ‘19 release (API version 45.0), you can build Lightning components using two programming models: the Lightning Web Components model and the original Aura Components model. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page. This content covers Aura components. To learn more about Lightning Web Components, take the Lightning Web Components Basics module.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      You can use the Developer Console to create Aura components. Using the Developer Console, you can create a component bundle. A component bundle acts like a folder in that it contains components and all other related resources, such as style sheets, controllers, and design.
      To learn more about Aura components, zip through the nearest wormhole to the Aura Component Basics module. For now, we’ll focus on how to use the Developer Console to create them.
    
    
      
        Create an Aura Component
      
      You’re bound to encounter other humans as you evade asteroid 2014 QO441, and we want them to know you’re friendly so they don’t open fire on you. Fortunately, your ship has large display panels on the sides that are running the Salesforce app. (You knew those would come in handy someday!) Let’s create a component that greets any other spaceship nearby.
          Select File | New | Lightning Component. The window that pops up prompts you for a name and description.
          Name your component meetGreet and click Submit. The window also has options to configure your app’s tab, page, record page, and communities page. You can ignore these options. For now, we’re only focusing on writing basic Aura component code.
          Two tabs are created. Click the one labeled meetGreet.cmp. This file contains the opening and closing tags for Aura components.
          Between the opening and closing &lt;aura:component&gt; and &lt;/aura:component&gt;tags, copy and paste this line.   &lt;p&gt;Greetings, fellow humans! What’s your status?&lt;/p&gt;Copy

      Congratulations: You’ve created your first Aura component using the Developer Console! To build it out completely there are a few more steps, but you can delegate that work to a crew member.
      For now, take a sneak peek at the list on the right-hand side of the window. It includes all the resources in a component bundle that you can use to build your component. If you click any item in the right sidebar, a corresponding resource opens. You can write code in the new resource to build the different parts of the component bundle. For instance, you can use the Style resource to add visual elements to your application and the Helper to add business logic.
      
      Here’s how you can open a saved Aura component or any of these resources.
          Select File | Open Lightning Resources.
          Type your component’s name in the search box to find your bundle, or select its folder from the list.
          To see the bundle’s resources, click the arrow next to the folder.

      You’ve learned how to use your console to create Apex code and Aura components. Now it’s time to check out Visualforce.
      Visualforce is a web development framework for building sophisticated user interfaces for mobile and desktop apps. These interfaces are hosted on the Lightning Platform. Your user interface can look like the standard Salesforce interface, or you can customize it.
      Now you must be wondering, what’s the difference between Visualforce and Lightning components? Visualforce is page-centric: When you save a record, the Visualforce page interacts with the server and reloads the user interface (UI). The Lightning components framework, in contrast, does much of its work on your device (on the client side, in geek speak). If you want to learn more about the differences between Visualforce and Lightning components, check out the Lightning Experience Development module.
      If you want to explore the world of Visualforce, check out the Visualforce Basics module.
      But first, let’s start building a Visualforce page using the Developer Console. Get ready to take the controls!
    
    
      
        Create a Visualforce Page
      
      You have a Flight Systems Checklist that your Control Engineers update every 2 hours, when they perform their engine and fuel tank safety checks. Let’s create a Visualforce page that they can use to report their findings.
      A functional Flight Systems Checklist page needs to interact with objects that store the values entered by the Control Engineers. But, for now, let’s focus on creating the UI. You can have your underlings create those custom objects.
      
        
          Select File | New | Visualforce Page.
          Name your page FlightSystemsChecklist.
          In the text editor, copy and paste the following code.&lt;apex:page sidebar="false"&gt;
&lt;!--Flight Systems Checklist Visualforce Page--&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Checklist&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;/apex:form&gt;
&lt;/apex:page&gt;Copy
          
          Select File | Save.
          In the top left corner, click Preview. Your browser opens a preview of your Visualforce page. The Visualforce markup in your page—form, pageBlock, inputCheckbox, and so on—is rendered in the preview.&nbsp;

A good example is the productCard component in the ebikes sample repo. Let's examine that card component, and build our own version from scratch so you can see how it evolves into a full-fledged Lightning web component. You'll quickly get the basics when you build up the parts of a component and explore more samples.
A component simply needs a folder and its files with the same name. They're automatically linked by name and location.

2023-04-04 11:36:51,988 - INFO - Processed paragraph 6 in 1_lightning-web-components-basics_create-lightning-web-components_content.txt: All Lightning web components have a namespace that's separated from the folder name by a hyphen. For example, the markup for the Lightning web component with the folder name app in the default namespace c is &lt;c-app&gt;.
However, the Salesforce platform doesn't allow hyphens in the component folder or file names. What if a component's name has more than one word, like “mycomponent”? You can't name the folder and files my-component, but we do have a handy solution.
Use camel case to name your component myComponent. Camel case component folder names map to kebab-case in markup. In markup, to reference a component with the folder name myComponent, use &lt;c-my-component&gt;.
For example, the LWC Samples repo has the viewSource folder containing the files for the viewSource component. When the hello component references the viewSource component in HTML, it uses c-view-source.

Public properties define the API for a component. An owner component that uses the component in its HTML markup can access the component's public properties. All public properties are reactive, which means that the framework observes the property for changes. When the property's value changes, the framework reacts and rerenders the component.
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Field and property are almost interchangeable terms. A component author declares fields in a JavaScript class. An instance of the class has properties. To component consumers, fields are properties. In a Lightning web component, only fields that a component author decorates with @api are publicly available to consumers as object properties.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
@track: Tells the framework to observe changes to the properties of an object or to the elements of an array. If a change occurs, the framework rerenders the component. All fields are reactive. If the value of a field changes and the field is used in a template—or in the getter of a property used in a template—the framework rerenders the component. You don't need to decorate the field with @track. Use @track only if a field contains an object or an array and if you want the framework to observe changes to the properties of the object or to the elements of the array. If you want to change the value of the whole property, you don't need to use @track.
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Prior to Spring '20, you had to use @track to mark fields (also known as private properties) as reactive. You're no longer required to do that. Use @track only to tell the framework to observe changes to the properties of an object or to the elements of an array. Some legacy examples may still use @track where it isn't needed, but that's OK because using the decorator doesn't change the functionality or break the code. For more information, see this release note.

    While formula fields calculate values using fields within a single record, roll-up summary fields calculate values from a set of related records, such as those in a related list. You can create roll-up summary fields that automatically display a value on a master record based on the values of records in a detail record. These detail records must be directly related to the master through a master-detail relationship.
    You can perform different types of calculations with roll-up summary fields. You can count the number of detail records related to a master record, or calculate the sum, minimum value, or maximum value of a field in the detail records. For example, you might want:
        A custom account field that calculates the total of all related pending opportunities.
        A custom order field that sums the unit prices of products that contain a description you specify.

    Since roll-up summary fields are based on master-detail relationships, it’s useful to review object relationships before creating a roll-up summary field.
    
      
        Master-Detail Relationships
      
      Master-detail relationships closely link objects together so that the master record controls specific behaviors of the detail and subdetail record.
      You define a roll-up summary field on the object that is on the master side of a master-detail relationship. For example, you can create a roll-up summary field on the Account object, summarizing related opportunities:
      
      There are a few different types of summaries you can use.
          
            
              
                Type
                Description
              
            
            
              
                COUNT
                Totals the number of related records.
              
              
                SUM
                Totals the values in the field you select in the Field to Aggregate option. Only number, currency, and percent fields are available.
              
              
                MIN
                Displays the lowest value of the field you select in the Field to Aggregate option for all directly related records. Only number, currency, percent, date, and date/time fields are available.
              
              
                MAX
                Displays the highest value of the field you select in the Field to Aggregate option for all directly related records. Only number, currency, percent, date, and date/time fields are available.

    Congratulations on creating your first roll-up summary field! Keep in mind that the types of fields you can calculate in a roll-up summary field depend on the type of calculation. For example:
        Number, currency, and percent fields are available when you select SUM as the roll-up type.
        Number, currency, percent, date, and date/time fields are available when you select MIN or MAX as the roll-up type.

2023-04-04 11:41:59,390 - INFO - Processed paragraph 8 in 1_secure-serverside-development_mitigate-soql-injection_content.txt: With all these limitations enforced by the platform, you might be wondering if it’s even possible to execute an injection attack. Unfortunately, a developer can still trust user input incorrectly, leading to an exposure of information via what is referred to as a SOQL injection attack.
Imagine that we have a developer org called School District Management that we use to manage and defend our School District Platform. Let’s walk through an example in our imaginary School District developer org to see how this can be exploited.
In this org we’ve developed a custom page that enables users to search through their districts to get an overview of the personnel. This list is filterable by providing a title or an age filter in the search box.
Typing in a title filter like teacher returns a list of people who have the title “teacher”.
Let's take a look at the underlying SOQL query that’s being used by the application.

String whereClause = 'Title__c like \'%'+textualTitle+'%\' ';
List&lt;Books&gt; whereclause_records = database.query(query+' where '+whereClause);Copy
  
  The application takes in the textualTitle parameter submitted by the user and inserts it directly into the SOQL query. This behavior can open a vulnerability to SOQL injection! Remember, SOQL injection occurs when an attacker modifies the structure of the query.&nbsp;

For instance, we can enter a filter in the title search to have the database identify personnel with low performance ratings: %' and Performance_rating__c&lt;2 and name like '%.
The reason why this works is because the user input is concatenated into the SOQL query without any validation, enabling the attacker to close the single quote for the title parameter and add another condition to the query. This results in a syntactically valid query.
Before:
Title__c like '%'+textualTitle+'%'
After:
Title__c like '% %' and Performance_rating__c&lt;2 and name like '% %'';Copy

If a user types a value like test’ LIMIT 1 when the database performs the query, it looks for any first names that are “test’ LIMIT 1” in the database. With a bind variable, the attacker isn’t able to break out and control the SOQL query.
While using bind variables is recommended, there are some limitations. They can only be used &nbsp;in the following types of clauses.

Typecasting
Another strategy to prevent SOQL injection is to use typecasting. By casting all variables as strings, user input can drift outside of expectation. By typecasting variables as integers or Booleans, when applicable, erroneous user input is not permitted. The variable can then be transformed back to a string for insertion into the query using string.valueOf() (remember with dynamic queries, the database.query() method accepts only a string).
Once again, we would use our imaginary School District developer org to search personnel by providing an age filter value.&nbsp;
If we enter a simple SOQL injection payload “1 limit 1” and search, the query returns only one result, because our input is treated as code.
The Apex code would look like this:
public String textualAge {get; set;} 
[...] 
whereClause+='Age__c &gt;'+textualAge+'';
whereclause_records = database.query(query+' where '+whereClause);Copy

You can also see that there are no single quotes around textualAge in the query.&nbsp;
If you were to test out string.escapeSingleQuotes(),you would edit the controller and wrap textualAge in string.escapeSingleQuotes().
If you apply the same SOQL injection payload of “1 limit 1” to your search, you see that the SOQL injection still functions.&nbsp;
The actual query with your SOQL injection would look like:
‘Select Name, Role__c, Title__c, Age__c from Personnel__c where Age__c &gt; 1 limit 1’Copy

You would want to edit the controller again, and remove string.escapeSingleQuotes(). Then you’d want to find the variable declaration for textualAge and change it from String to Integer (age is an integer, so this typecasting is appropriate). Because the query is expecting a string but textualAge is now an integer, you need to wrap textualAge in string.valueOf() as follows:
whereClause+='Age__c &gt;'+string.valueOf(textualAge)+'';Copy

Typecasting can be used like this to prevent many kinds of SOQL injection where the user is not entering text.
Escaping Single Quotes
Another cross-site scripting (XSS) mitigation option that is commonly used by developers who include user-controlled strings in their queries is the platform-provided escape function string.escapeSingleQuotes().
This function escapes any instance that it finds of a single quote mark (‘) in the string using the backslash (\) escape character. This prevents an attacker’s input from being treated as code by constraining them to the boundary of the string.
Let’s walk through an example. Similar to the previous SOQL injection example, but in this case, you search for personnel by title. Let’s see if our previous payload would work in this case to leak information about low performers in the school district.
Our previous payload %' and Performance_rating__c&lt;2 and name like'% returns a single result as before. However, through SOQL injection we’ve learned a piece of information we were not supposed to know!
The Apex code for this would look like the following:

In the example above, replacing the where clause with the following code wrapping&nbsp;textualTitle&nbsp;with&nbsp;String.escapeSingleQuotes()&nbsp;will prevent an attacker from using SOQL injection to modify the query behavior.
String whereClause = 'Title__c like \'%'+String.escapeSingleQuotes(textualTitle)+'%\' ';Copy

Another way to prevent SOQL injection without string.escapeSingleQuotes() is allowlisting. Create a list of all “known good” values that the user is allowed to supply. If the user enters anything else, you reject the response.&nbsp;

    Create and modify records in Salesforce by using the Data Manipulation Language, abbreviated as DML. DML provides a straightforward way to manage records by providing simple statements to insert, update, merge, delete, and restore records.
    
    Because Apex is a data-focused language and is saved on the Lightning Platform, it has direct access to your data in Salesforce. Unlike other programming languages that require additional setup to connect to data sources, with Apex DML, managing records is made easy! By calling DML statements, you can quickly perform operations on your Salesforce records.This example adds the Acme account to Salesforce. An account sObject is created first and then passed as an argument to the insertstatement, which persists the record in Salesforce.
// Create the account sObject 
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);
// Insert the account by using DML
insert acct;Copy
      
    
    
      DML Statements
      The following DML statements are available.
      
        insert
        update
        upsert
        delete
        undelete
        merge
      
      Each DML statement accepts either a single sObject or a list (or array) of sObjects. Operating on a list of sObjects is a more efficient way for processing records.
      All those statements, except a couple, are familiar database operations. The upsert and merge statements are particular to Salesforce and can be quite handy.
      The upsert DML operation creates new records and updates sObject records within a single statement, using a specified field to determine the presence of existing objects, or the ID field if no field is specified.
      The merge statement merges up to three records of the same sObject type into one of the records, deleting the others, and re-parenting any related records.
    
    
      ID Field Auto-Assigned to New Records
      When inserting records, the system assigns an ID for each record. In addition to persisting the ID value in the database, the ID value is also auto-populated on the sObject variable that you used as an argument in the DML call.
      This example shows how to get the ID on the sObject that corresponds to the inserted account.
      
// Create the account sObject 
Account acct = new Account(Name='Acme', Phone='(415)555-1212', NumberOfEmployees=100);
// Insert the account by using DML
insert acct;
// Get the new ID on the inserted sObject argument
ID acctID = acct.Id;
// Display this ID in the debug log
System.debug('ID = ' + acctID);
// Debug log result (the ID will be different in your case)
// DEBUG|ID = 001D000000JmKkeIAFCopy
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                          
                            Beyond the Basics
                            Because the sObject variable in the example contains the ID after the DML call, you can reuse this sObject variable to perform further DML operations, such as updates, as the system will be able to map the sObject variable to its corresponding record by matching the ID.
                            You can retrieve a record from the database to obtain its fields, including the ID field, but this can’t be done with DML. You’ll need to write a query by using SOQL. You’ll learn about SOQL in another unit.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Bulk DML
      You can perform DML operations either on a single sObject, or in bulk on a list of sObjects. Performing bulk DML operations is the recommended way because it helps avoid hitting governor limits, such as the DML limit of 150 statements per Apex transaction. This limit is in place to ensure fair access to shared resources in the Lightning Platform. Performing a DML operation on a list of sObjects counts as one DML statement, not as one statement for each sObject.
      This example inserts contacts in bulk by inserting a list of contacts in one call. The sample then updates those contacts in bulk too.
      
        Execute this snippet in the Developer Console using Anonymous Apex.// Create a list of contacts
List&lt;Contact&gt; conList = new List&lt;Contact&gt; {
    new Contact(FirstName='Joe',LastName='Smith',Department='Finance'),
        new Contact(FirstName='Kathy',LastName='Smith',Department='Technology'),
        new Contact(FirstName='Caroline',LastName='Roth',Department='Finance'),
        new Contact(FirstName='Kim',LastName='Shain',Department='Education')};
// Bulk insert all contacts with one DML call
insert conList;
// List to hold the new contacts to update
List&lt;Contact&gt; listToUpdate = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();
// Iterate through the list and add a title only
//   if the department is Finance
for(Contact con : conList) {
    if (con.Department == 'Finance') {
        con.Title = 'Financial analyst';
        // Add updated contact sObject to the list.
        listToUpdate.add(con);
    }
}
// Bulk update all contacts with one DML call
update listToUpdate;Copy
        
        Inspect the contacts recently created in your org.Two of the contacts who are in the Finance department should have their titles populated with Financial analyst.

2023-04-04 11:43:40,723 - INFO - Processed paragraph 4 in 2_apex_database_apex_database_dml_content.txt: Upsert Records
      If you have a list containing a mix of new and existing records, you can process insertions and updates to all records in the list by using the upsert statement. Upsert helps avoid the creation of duplicate records and can save you time as you don’t have to determine which records exist first.
      The upsert statement matches the sObjects with existing records by comparing values of one field. If you don’t specify a field when calling this statement, the upsert statement uses the sObject’s ID to match the sObject with existing records in Salesforce. Alternatively, you can specify a field to use for matching. For custom objects, specify a custom field marked as external ID. For standard objects, you can specify any field that has the idLookup property set to true. For example, the Email field of Contact or User has the idLookup property set. To check a field’s property, see the Object Reference for Salesforce and Lightning Platform.
      Upsert Syntax
      upsert&nbsp;sObject | sObject[]
      upsert&nbsp;sObject | sObject[]&nbsp;field
      The optional field is a field token. For example, to specify the MyExternalID field, the statement is:
upsert sObjectList Account.Fields.MyExternalId;Copy
        
      
      Upsert uses the sObject record's primary key (the ID), an idLookup field, or an external ID field to determine whether it should create a new record or update an existing one:
      
        If the key is not matched, a new object record is created.
        If the key is matched once, the existing object record is updated.
        If the key is matched multiple times, an error is generated and the object record is neither inserted or updated.
      
      This example shows how upsert updates an existing contact record and inserts a new contact in one call. This upsert call updates the existing Josh contact and inserts a new contact, Kathy.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  The upsert call uses the ID to match the first contact. The josh variable is being reused for the upsert call. This variable has already been populated with the record ID from the previous insert call, so the ID doesn’t need to be set explicitly in this example.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Execute this snippet in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console.// Insert the Josh contact
Contact josh = new Contact(FirstName='Josh',LastName='Kaplan',Department='Finance');       
insert josh;
// Josh's record has been inserted
//   so the variable josh has now an ID
//   which will be used to match the records by upsert
josh.Description = 'Josh\'s record has been updated by the upsert operation.';
// Create the Kathy contact, but don't persist it in the database
Contact kathy = new Contact(FirstName='Kathy',LastName='Brown',Department='Technology');
// List to hold the new contacts to upsert
List&lt;Contact&gt; contacts = new List&lt;Contact&gt; { josh, kathy };
// Call upsert
upsert contacts;
// Result: Josh is updated and Kathy is created.Copy
        
        Inspect all contacts in your org.Your org will have only one Josh Kaplan record, not two, because the upsert operation found the existing record and updated it instead of creating a new contact record. One Kathy Brown contact record will be there too.
      
      Alternatively, you can specify a field to be used for matching records. This example uses the Email field on Contact because it has idLookup property set. The example inserts the Jane Smith contact, and creates a second Contact sObject, populates it with the same email, then calls upsert to update the contact by using the email field for matching.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  If insert was used in this example instead of upsert, a duplicate Jane Smith contact would have been inserted.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Execute this snippet in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console.Contact jane = new Contact(FirstName='Jane',
                         LastName='Smith',
                         Email='jane.smith@example.com',
                         Description='Contact of the day');
insert jane;
// 1. Upsert using an idLookup field
// Create a second sObject variable.
// This variable doesn’t have any ID set.
Contact jane2 = new Contact(FirstName='Jane',
                         LastName='Smith',  
                         Email='jane.smith@example.com',
                         Description='Prefers to be contacted by email.');
// Upsert the contact by using the idLookup field for matching.
upsert jane2 Contact.fields.Email;
// Verify that the contact has been updated
System.assertEquals('Prefers to be contacted by email.',
                   [SELECT Description FROM Contact WHERE Id=:jane.Id].Description);Copy
        
        Inspect all contacts in your org.Your org will have only one Jane Smith contact with the updated description.
      
    
    
      Delete Records
      You can delete persisted records using the delete statement. Deleted records aren’t deleted permanently from Lightning Platform, but they’re placed in the Recycle Bin for 15 days from where they can be restored.
      This example shows how to delete all contacts whose last name is Smith. If you’ve run the sample for bulk DML, your org should already have two contacts with the last name of Smith. Execute this snippet in the Developer Console using Anonymous Apex, and then verify that there are no contacts with the last name Smith anymore.
      
Contact[] contactsDel = [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE LastName='Smith']; 
delete contactsDel;Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  This snippet includes a query to retrieve the contacts (a SOQL query). You’ll learn more about SOQL in another unit.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      DML Statement Exceptions
      If a DML operation fails, it returns an exception of type DmlException. You can catch exceptions in your code to handle error conditions.
      This example produces a DmlException because it attempts to insert an account without the required Name field. The exception is caught in the catch block.
      
try {
    // This causes an exception because 
    //   the required Name field is not provided.
    Account acct = new Account();
    // Insert the account 
    insert acct;
} catch (DmlException e) {
    System.debug('A DML exception has occurred: ' +
                e.getMessage());

2023-04-04 11:44:08,987 - INFO - Processed paragraph 6 in 2_apex_database_apex_database_dml_content.txt: Database Methods
  
  
    Apex contains the built-in Database class, which provides methods that perform DML operations and mirror the DML statement counterparts.
    
      These Database methods are static and are called on the class name.
      
        Database.insert()
        Database.update()
        Database.upsert()
        Database.delete()
        Database.undelete()
        Database.merge()
      
      Unlike DML statements, Database methods have an optional allOrNone parameter that allows you to specify whether the operation should partially succeed. When this parameter is set to false, if errors occur on a partial set of records, the successful records will be committed and errors will be returned for the failed records. Also, no exceptions are thrown with the partial success option.
      This is how you call the insert method with the allOrNone set to false.
      
Database.insert(recordList, false);Copy
      
      The Database methods return result objects containing success or failure information for each record. For example, insert and update operations each return an array of Database.SaveResult objects.
      
Database.SaveResult[] results = Database.insert(recordList, false);Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  Upsert returns Database.UpsertResult objects, and delete returns Database.DeleteResult objects.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      By default, the allOrNone parameter is true, which means that the Database method behaves like its DML statement counterpart and will throw an exception if a failure is encountered.
      The following two statements are equivalent to the insert recordList; statement.
      
Database.insert(recordList);Copy
      
      And:
      
Database.insert(recordList, true);Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                          
                            Beyond the Basics
                            In addition to these methods, the Database class contains methods that aren’t provided as DML statements. For example, methods used for transaction control and rollback, for emptying the Recycle Bin, and methods related to SOQL queries. You’ll learn about SOQL in another unit.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Example: Insert Records with Partial Success
      Let’s take a look at an example that uses the Database methods. This example is based on the bulk DML example, but replaces the DML statement with a Database method. The Database.insert() method is called with the partial success option. One contact in the list doesn’t have any fields on purpose and will cause an error because the contact can’t be saved without the required LastName field. Three contacts are committed and the contact without any fields generates an error. The last part of this example iterates through the returned results and writes debug messages to the debug log.
      
        Execute this example in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console.// Create a list of contacts
List&lt;Contact&gt; conList = new List&lt;Contact&gt; {
        new Contact(FirstName='Joe',LastName='Smith',Department='Finance'),
        new Contact(FirstName='Kathy',LastName='Smith',Department='Technology'),
        new Contact(FirstName='Caroline',LastName='Roth',Department='Finance'),
        new Contact()};
// Bulk insert all contacts with one DML call
Database.SaveResult[] srList = Database.insert(conList, false);
// Iterate through each returned result
for (Database.SaveResult sr : srList) {
    if (sr.isSuccess()) {
        // Operation was successful, so get the ID of the record that was processed
        System.debug('Successfully inserted contact. Contact ID: ' + sr.getId());
    } else {
        // Operation failed, so get all errors
        for(Database.Error err : sr.getErrors()) {
            System.debug('The following error has occurred.');
            System.debug(err.getStatusCode() + ': ' + err.getMessage());
            System.debug('Contact fields that affected this error: ' + err.getFields());
	 }
    }
}Copy
        
        Verify the debug messages (use the DEBUG keyword for the filter).One failure should be reported and three contacts should have been inserted.
      
    
    
      Should You Use DML Statements or Database Methods?
      
        Use DML statements if you want any error that occurs during bulk DML processing to be thrown as an Apex exception that immediately interrupts control flow (by using try. . .catch blocks). This behavior is similar to the way exceptions are handled in most database procedural languages.
      
      
        Use Database class methods if you want to allow partial success of a bulk DML operation—if a record fails, the remainder of the DML operation can still succeed. Your application can then inspect the rejected records and possibly retry the operation. When using this form, you can write code that never throws DML exception errors. Instead, your code can use the appropriate results array to judge success or failure. Note that Database methods also include a syntax that supports thrown exceptions, similar to DML statements.

  Create and manage records that are related to each other through relationships.
  
  
    Insert Related Records
    You can insert records related to existing records if a relationship has already been defined between the two objects, such as a lookup or master-detail relationship. A record is associated with a related record through a foreign key ID. For example, if inserting a new contact, you can specify the contact's related account record by setting the value of the AccountId field.
    This example shows how to add a contact to an account (the related record) by setting the AccountId field on the contact. Contact and Account are linked through a lookup relationship.
    
      Execute this snippet in the Anonymous Apex window of the Developer Console.Account acct = new Account(Name='SFDC Account');
insert acct;
// Once the account is inserted, the sObject will be 
// populated with an ID.
// Get this ID.
ID acctID = acct.ID;
// Add a contact to this account.
Contact mario = new Contact(
    FirstName='Mario',
    LastName='Ruiz',
    Phone='415.555.1212',
    AccountId=acctID);
insert mario;Copy
      
      Inspect the contacts in your org.A new account (SFDC Account) has been created and has the Mario Ruiz contact in the account’s Contacts related list.
    
    
      Update Related Records
      Fields on related records can't be updated with the same call to the DML operation and require a separate DML call. For example, if inserting a new contact, you can specify the contact's related account record by setting the value of the AccountId field. However, you can't change the account's name without updating the account itself with a separate DML call. Similarly, when updating a contact, if you also want to update the contact’s related account, you must make two DML calls. The following example updates a contact and its related account using two update&nbsp;statements.
// Query for the contact, which has been associated with an account.
Contact queriedContact = [SELECT Account.Name 
                          FROM Contact 
                          WHERE FirstName = 'Mario' AND LastName='Ruiz'
                          LIMIT 1];
// Update the contact's phone number
queriedContact.Phone = '(415)555-1213';
// Update the related account industry
queriedContact.Account.Industry = 'Technology';
// Make two separate calls 
// 1. This call is to update the contact's phone.
update queriedContact;
// 2. This call is to update the related account's Industry field.
update queriedContact.Account; Copy
        
      
    
    
      Delete Related Records
      The delete operation supports cascading deletions. If you delete a parent object, you delete its children automatically, as long as each child record can be deleted.
      For example, deleting the account you created earlier (SFDC Account) will delete its related contact too.
      
        Execute this snippet in the Anonymous Apex window of the Developer Console.Account[] queriedAccounts = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name='SFDC Account'];
delete queriedAccounts;Copy
        
        Check the accounts and contacts in your org.You’ll see that both the account and its related contact were deleted.
      
    
    
      About Transactions
      DML operations execute within a transaction. All DML operations in a transaction either complete successfully, or if an error occurs in one operation, the entire transaction is rolled back and no data is committed to the database. The boundary of a transaction can be a trigger, a class method, an anonymous block of code, an Apex page, or a custom Web service method. For example, if a trigger or class creates two accounts and updates one contact, and the contact update fails because of a validation rule failure, the entire transaction rolls back and none of the accounts are persisted in Salesforce.

  Use test utility classes to add reusable methods for test data setup.
  
    Prerequisites
  
  
    
      Complete the prerequisites in the previous unit, Test Apex Triggers, if you haven’t done so already.
    
    
      
        Add a Test Utility Class
      
      Let’s refactor the previous test method by replacing test data creation with a call to a utility class method. First, you need to create the test utility class.
      The TestDataFactory class is a special type of class—it is a public class that is annotated with @isTest and can be accessed only from a running test. Test utility classes contain methods that can be called by test methods to perform useful tasks, such as setting up test data. Test utility classes are excluded from the org’s code size limit.
      To add the TestDataFactory class:
      
        In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Class, and enter TestDataFactory for the class name, and then click OK.
        Replace the default class body with the following.@isTest
public class TestDataFactory {
    public static List&lt;Account&gt; createAccountsWithOpps(Integer numAccts, Integer numOppsPerAcct) {
        List&lt;Account&gt; accts = new List&lt;Account&gt;();
        for(Integer i=0;i&lt;numAccts;i++) {
            Account a = new Account(Name='TestAccount' + i);
            accts.add(a);
        }
        insert accts;
        List&lt;Opportunity&gt; opps = new List&lt;Opportunity&gt;();
        for (Integer j=0;j&lt;numAccts;j++) {
            Account acct = accts[j];
            // For each account just inserted, add opportunities
            for (Integer k=0;k&lt;numOppsPerAcct;k++) {
                opps.add(new Opportunity(Name=acct.Name + ' Opportunity ' + k,
                                       StageName='Prospecting',
                                       CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                       AccountId=acct.Id));
            }
        }
        // Insert all opportunities for all accounts.
        insert opps;
        return accts;
    }
}Copy
        
      
      This test utility class contains one static method, createAccountsWithOpps(), which accepts the number of accounts (held in the numAccts parameter) and the number of related opportunities to create for each account (held in the numOppsPerAcct parameter). The first loop in the method creates the specified number of accounts and stores them in the accts list variable. After the first loop, the insert() DML statement is called to create all accounts in the list in the database.
      The second loop creates the opportunities. Because each group of opportunities are linked to one account, the outer loop iterates through accounts and contains a nested loop that creates related opportunities for the current account. The next time the nested loop is run, opportunities are added to the same list using the add() method. Opportunities are linked to their parent accounts using the AccountId field. The total number of all opportunities that are created is the product of the number of opportunities with the number of accounts (numOppsPerAcct*numAccts). Next, the insert() DML statement is efficiently called outside the loop to create all opportunities in the collection for all accounts in one call only.
      Finally, this method returns a list of the new accounts.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Even though this method doesn’t return the related opportunities, you can get those records by writing a SOQL query that makes use of the existing relationship between Account and Opportunity, such as the query used in the trigger in Testing Apex Triggers.
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        Call Utility Methods for Test Data Creation
      
    
    
      Now that you’ve added the test utility class, modify the test class to take advantage of this class. In the TestAccountDeletion class, replace the block that starts with // Test data setup and ends with insert opp; with:
      
        // Test data setup
        // Create one account with one opportunity by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(1,1);Copy
      
      The array returned by the TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(1,1) call contains one Account sObject.
      Here’s the modified test method. A shorter version!
      
@isTest
private class TestAccountDeletion {
    @isTest static void TestDeleteAccountWithOneOpportunity() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create one account with one opportunity by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(1,1);
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult result = Database.delete(accts[0], false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Verify that the deletion should have been stopped by the trigger,
        // so check that we got back an error.
        System.assert(!result.isSuccess());
        System.assert(result.getErrors().size() &gt; 0);
        System.assertEquals('Cannot delete account with related opportunities.',
                             result.getErrors()[0].getMessage());
    }        
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Test for Different Conditions
      
      One test method is not enough to test all the possible inputs for the trigger. We need to test some other conditions, such as when an account without opportunities is deleted. We also need to test the same scenarios with a bulk number of records instead of just a single record. Here is an updated version of the test class that contains the three additional test methods. Save this updated version of the class.
      
@isTest
private class TestAccountDeletion {
    @isTest static void TestDeleteAccountWithOneOpportunity() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create one account with one opportunity by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(1,1);
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult result = Database.delete(accts[0], false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Verify that the deletion should have been stopped by the trigger,
        // so check that we got back an error.
        System.assert(!result.isSuccess());
        System.assert(result.getErrors().size() &gt; 0);
        System.assertEquals('Cannot delete account with related opportunities.',
                             result.getErrors()[0].getMessage());
    }
    @isTest static void TestDeleteAccountWithNoOpportunities() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create one account with no opportunities by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(1,0);
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult result = Database.delete(accts[0], false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Verify that the deletion was successful
        System.assert(result.isSuccess());
    }
    @isTest static void TestDeleteBulkAccountsWithOneOpportunity() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create accounts with one opportunity each by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(200,1);
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult[] results = Database.delete(accts, false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Verify for each record.
        // In this case the deletion should have been stopped by the trigger,
        // so check that we got back an error.
        for(Database.DeleteResult dr : results) {
            System.assert(!dr.isSuccess());
            System.assert(dr.getErrors().size() &gt; 0);
            System.assertEquals('Cannot delete account with related opportunities.',
                                 dr.getErrors()[0].getMessage());
        }
    }
    @isTest static void TestDeleteBulkAccountsWithNoOpportunities() {
        // Test data setup
        // Create accounts with no opportunities by calling a utility method
        Account[] accts = TestDataFactory.createAccountsWithOpps(200,0);
        // Perform test
        Test.startTest();
        Database.DeleteResult[] results = Database.delete(accts, false);
        Test.stopTest();
        // For each record, verify that the deletion was successful
        for(Database.DeleteResult dr : results) {
            System.assert(dr.isSuccess());
        }
    }
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Run All Test Methods
      
      The final step is to run the test methods in our test class, now that the class contains more comprehensive tests and has been refactored to use a test data factory. Since you’ve already run the tests in the TestAccountDeletion class, you can just rerun this test class to run all its test methods.
      
        To execute the same test run, click the Tests tab, select your test run, and then click Test | Rerun.
        Check the results in the Tests tab by expanding the latest test run. The test run should report that all four tests passed!

    Batch Apex
  
  
    Batch Apex is used to run large jobs (think thousands or millions of records!) that would exceed normal processing limits. Using Batch Apex, you can process records asynchronously in batches (hence the name, “Batch Apex”) to stay within platform limits. If you have a lot of records to process, for example, data cleansing or archiving, Batch Apex is probably your best solution.
    Here’s how Batch Apex works under the hood. Let’s say you want to process 1 million records using Batch Apex. The execution logic of the batch class is called once for each batch of records you are processing. Each time you invoke a batch class, the job is placed on the Apex job queue and is executed as a discrete transaction. This functionality has two awesome advantages: 
      
        Every transaction starts with a new set of governor limits, making it easier to ensure that your code stays within the governor execution limits.
        If one batch fails to process successfully, all other successful batch transactions aren’t rolled back.

    To write a Batch Apex class, your class must implement the Database.Batchable interface and include the following three methods:
start
    Used to collect the records or objects to be passed to the interface method execute for processing. This method is called once at the beginning of a Batch Apex job and returns either a Database.QueryLocator object or an Iterable that contains the records or objects passed to the job.
    Most of the time a QueryLocator does the trick with a simple SOQL query to generate the scope of objects in the batch job. But if you need to do something crazy like loop through the results of an API call or pre-process records before being passed to the execute method, you might want to check out the Custom Iterators link in the Resources section.
    With the QueryLocator object, the governor limit for the total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries is bypassed and you can query up to 50 million records. However, with an Iterable, the governor limit for the total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries is still enforced.
execute
    Performs the actual processing for each chunk or “batch” of data passed to the method. The default batch size is 200 records. Batches of records are not guaranteed to execute in the order they are received from the start method.
    This method takes the following: 
      
        A reference to the Database.BatchableContext object.
        A list of sObjects, such as List&lt;sObject&gt;, or a list of parameterized types. If you are using a Database.QueryLocator, use the returned list.
      
    
finishUsed to execute post-processing operations (for example, sending an email) and is called once after all batches are processed.Here’s what the skeleton of a Batch Apex class looks like:
    
public class MyBatchClass implements Database.Batchable&lt;sObject&gt; {
    public (Database.QueryLocator | Iterable&lt;sObject&gt;) start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
        // collect the batches of records or objects to be passed to execute
    }
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List&lt;P&gt; records){
        // process each batch of records
    }
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc){
        // execute any post-processing operations
    }
}Copy

    To invoke a batch class, simply instantiate it and then call Database.executeBatch with the instance:
    
MyBatchClass myBatchObject = new MyBatchClass();
Id batchId = Database.executeBatch(myBatchObject);Copy
    
    You can also optionally pass a second scope parameter to specify the number of records that should be passed into the execute method for each batch. Pro tip: you might want to limit this batch size if you are running into governor limits.
    
Id batchId = Database.executeBatch(myBatchObject, 100);Copy
    
    Each batch Apex invocation creates an AsyncApexJob record so that you can track the job’s progress. You can view the progress via SOQL or manage your job in the Apex Job Queue. We’ll talk about the Job Queue shortly.

2023-04-04 11:46:39,155 - INFO - Processed paragraph 10 in 2_asynchronous_apex_async_apex_batch_content.txt: Using State in Batch Apex
  
  
    Batch Apex is typically stateless. Each execution of a batch Apex job is considered a discrete transaction. For example, a batch Apex job that contains 1,000 records and uses the default batch size is considered five transactions of 200 records each.
    If you specify Database.Stateful in the class definition, you can maintain state across all transactions. When using Database.Stateful, only instance member variables retain their values between transactions. Maintaining state is useful for counting or summarizing records as they’re processed. In our next example, we’ll be updating contact records in our batch job and want to keep track of the total records affected so we can include it in the notification email.
    
      
        Sample Batch Apex Code
      
      Now that you know how to write a Batch Apex class, let’s see a practical example. Let’s say you have a business requirement that states that all contacts for companies in the USA must have their parent company’s billing address as their mailing address. Unfortunately, users are entering new contacts without the correct addresses! Will users never learn?! Write a Batch Apex class that ensures that this requirement is enforced.
      The following sample class finds all account records that are passed in by the start() method using a QueryLocator and updates the associated contacts with their account’s mailing address. Finally, it sends off an email with the results of the bulk job and, since we are using Database.Stateful to track state, the number of records updated.
      
public class UpdateContactAddresses implements
    Database.Batchable&lt;sObject&gt;, Database.Stateful {
    // instance member to retain state across transactions
    public Integer recordsProcessed = 0;
    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
        return Database.getQueryLocator(
            'SELECT ID, BillingStreet, BillingCity, BillingState, ' +
            'BillingPostalCode, (SELECT ID, MailingStreet, MailingCity, ' +
            'MailingState, MailingPostalCode FROM Contacts) FROM Account ' +
            'Where BillingCountry = \'USA\''
        );
    }
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List&lt;Account&gt; scope){
        // process each batch of records
        List&lt;Contact&gt; contacts = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();
        for (Account account : scope) {
            for (Contact contact : account.contacts) {
                contact.MailingStreet = account.BillingStreet;
                contact.MailingCity = account.BillingCity;
                contact.MailingState = account.BillingState;
                contact.MailingPostalCode = account.BillingPostalCode;
                // add contact to list to be updated
                contacts.add(contact);
                // increment the instance member counter
                recordsProcessed = recordsProcessed + 1;
            }
        }
        update contacts;
    }
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc){
        System.debug(recordsProcessed + ' records processed. Shazam!');
        AsyncApexJob job = [SELECT Id, Status, NumberOfErrors,
            JobItemsProcessed,
            TotalJobItems, CreatedBy.Email
            FROM AsyncApexJob
            WHERE Id = :bc.getJobId()];
        // call some utility to send email
        EmailUtils.sendMessage(job, recordsProcessed);
    }
}Copy
      
      The code should be fairly straightforward but can be a little abstract in reality. Here’s what’s going on in more detail: 
        
          The start() method provides the collection of all records that the execute() method will process in individual batches. It returns the list of records to be processed by calling Database.getQueryLocator with a SOQL query. In this case we are simply querying for all Account records with a Billing Country of ‘USA’.
          Each batch of 200 records is passed in the second parameter of the execute() method. The execute() method sets each contact’s mailing address to the accounts’ billing address and increments recordsProcessed to track the number of records processed.
          When the job is complete, the finish method performs a query on the AsyncApexJob object (a table that lists information about batch jobs) to get the status of the job, the submitter’s email address, and some other information. It then sends a notification email to the job submitter that includes the job info and number of contacts updated.

    Because Apex development and testing go hand in hand, here’s how we test the above batch class. In a nutshell, we insert some records, call the Batch Apex class and then assert that the records were updated properly with the correct address.
    
@isTest
private class UpdateContactAddressesTest {

    static void setup() {
        List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = new List&lt;Account&gt;();
        List&lt;Contact&gt; contacts = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();
        // insert 10 accounts
        for (Integer i=0;i&lt;10;i++) {
            accounts.add(new Account(name='Account '+i,

        // find the account just inserted. add contact for each
        for (Account account : [select id from account]) {
            contacts.add(new Contact(firstname='first',
                lastname='last', accountId=account.id));

        Id batchId = Database.executeBatch(uca);
        Test.stopTest();
        // after the testing stops, assert records were updated properly
        System.assertEquals(10, [select count() from contact where MailingCity = 'New York']);
    }
}Copy
    
    The setup method inserts 10 account records with the billing city of ‘New York’ and the billing country of ‘USA’. Then for each account, it creates an associated contact record. This data is used by the batch class.
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Make sure that the number of records inserted is less than or equal to the batch size of 200 because test methods can execute only one batch. You must also ensure that the Iterable returned by the start() method matches the batch size.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    In the test() method, the UpdateContactAddresses batch class is instantiated, invoked by calling Database.executeBatch and passing it the instance of the batch class.
    The call to Database.executeBatch is included within the Test.startTest and Test.stopTest block. This is where all of the magic happens. The job executes after the call to Test.stopTest. Any asynchronous code included within Test.startTest and Test.stopTest is executed synchronously after Test.stopTest.
    Finally, the test verifies that all contact records were updated correctly by checking that the number of contact records with the billing city of ‘New York’ matches the number of records inserted (i.e., 10).

    As with future methods, there are a few things you want to keep in mind when using Batch Apex. To ensure fast execution of batch jobs, minimize Web service callout times and tune queries used in your batch Apex code. The longer the batch job executes, the more likely other queued jobs are delayed when many jobs are in the queue. Best practices include: 
      
        Only use Batch Apex if you have more than one batch of records. If you don't have enough records to run more than one batch, you are probably better off using Queueable Apex.
        Tune any SOQL query to gather the records to execute as quickly as possible.
        Minimize the number of asynchronous requests created to minimize the chance of delays.
        Use extreme care if you are planning to invoke a batch job from a trigger. You must be able to guarantee that the trigger won’t add more batch jobs than the limit.

      By now, you and D’Angelo have created a handful of custom objects, fields, and relationships. Your app’s data model is starting to get a little more complicated.
      Schema Builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your data model. It’s useful for designing and understanding complex data models like the one D’Angelo is building. Let’s take a look.
    
    
      From Setup, search for and click Schema Builder in the Quick Find box.&nbsp;

    As a good commander, you review the system logs to check that everything is in working order. Logs are one of the best places to identify problems with a system or program. Using the Developer Console, you can look at various debug logs to understand how your code works and to identify any performance issues.
    
      
        View Logs in the Text Editor
      
      Viewing a debug log is simple. To generate a log, let’s execute the EmailMissionSpecialist Apex class that you created earlier.
      You can view your log in two ways.
          
Before execution, enable Open Log in the Enter Apex Code window. The log opens after your code has been executed.
          
After execution, double-click the log that appears in the Logs tab.
        Let’s try the first method.
          Select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
          The Enter Apex Code window displays the last code that you entered for execution. If it’s different from the following code, delete it and paste the following code. Be sure to replace Enter your email addresswith your email address.EmailMissionSpecialist em = new EmailMissionSpecialist();
em.sendMail('Enter your email address', 'Flight Path Change', 
   'Mission Control 123: Your flight path has been changed to avoid collision '
   + 'with asteroid 2014 QO441.');Copy
          
          Select the Open Log option.
          Click Execute.
        
      
      The execution log that you see probably seems like a confusing jumble of numbers and words, so let’s talk about how you can read and understand log data.
      
    
    
      
        Read Your Log Data
      
      Let’s run the EmailMissionSpecialist class again, but this time let’s introduce an error. Then, let’s find the resulting log in the Logs tab.
      
        
          Select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window. Provide an invalid email address, such as testingemail. EmailMissionSpecialist em = new EmailMissionSpecialist();
em.sendMail('testingemail', 'Flight Path Change', 
   'Mission Control 123: Your flight path has been changed to avoid collision '
   + 'with asteroid 2014 QO441.');Copy
          
          Deselect the Open Log option.
          Click Execute.After you run the code, you see a dialog box that includes the error.&nbsp;

2023-04-04 11:52:10,959 - INFO - Processed paragraph 5 in 2_developer_console_developer_console_logs_content.txt: You can read a debug log by identifying what each column represents.
          
Timestamp—The time when the event occurred. The timestamp is always in the user’s time zone and in HH:mm:ss:SSS format.
          
Event—The event that triggered the debug log entry. For instance, in the execution log that you generated, the FATAL_ERROR event is logged when the email address is determined to be invalid.
          
Details—Details about the line of code and the method name where the code was executed.
        
        
      
      You can change what you see in the Execution Log by selecting This Frame (a), Executable (b), or Debug Only (c). Selecting these options shows you only certain types of events. For instance, Debug Only shows USER_DEBUG events. You can also filter different parts of the log using Filter (d). Enter a method name, or any other text you are specifically looking for, and the log filters your results.
      You can also view the debug log as a raw log, which shows you more information. Select File | Open Raw Log. The timestamp in a raw log shows the time elapsed in nanoseconds (in parentheses) since the start of the event.
      
      This combination of the timestamp, event, and details provides valuable insights into how your code works and the errors that occur.
      While all this information is great, what if you want to quickly look for certain values in the debug log? After all, you have many other responsibilities as commander. An excellent way to do so is to use the System.debug() method in Apex.
      The great thing about System.debug() is that you can add it anywhere in your code to track values, helping you debug your own code.
      Here is the syntax for System.debug(). To display a message:
System.debug('Your Message');Copy
        
      
      To display the value of a variable:
System.debug(yourVariable);Copy
        
      
      To display a labeled value:
System.debug('Your Label: ' + yourVariable);Copy

      The handy Log Inspector exists to make it easier to view large logs! The Log Inspector uses log panel views to provide different perspectives of your code. Check it out by selecting Debug | View Log Panels.
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  The Debug | View Log Panels menu option is available only when you’re viewing a debug log tab. If, for example, you’re viewing the raw log tab, the option is grayed out. 
                
              
            
          
        
      
      Log panels change the structure of the log, to give other helpful information about the context for the code being executed. For example, different panels show the source, execution times, heap size, and calling hierarchy. (We know, more geek speak—this section is relatively technical. Remember, we’re getting to know the Developer Console, not the finer points of debugging. So if anything doesn’t make sense to you, try not to worry about it too much.)
      These log panels interact with each other to help you debug your own code. For instance, when you click a log entry in the Execution Log or Stack Tree, the other panels (Source, Source List, Variables, and Execution Stack) refresh to show related information.
      
      These panels are available in the Log Inspector.
          
Stack Tree—Displays log entries within the hierarchy of their objects and their execution using a top-down tree view. For instance, if one class calls a second class, the second class is shown as the child of the first.
          
Execution Stack—Displays a bottom-up view of the selected item. It displays the log entry, followed by the operation that called it.
          
Execution Log—Displays every action that occurred during the execution of your code.
          
Source—Displays the contents of the source file, indicating the line of code being run when the selected log entry was generated.
          
Source List—Displays the context of the code being executed when the event was logged. For example, if you select the log entry generated when the faulty email address value was entered, the Source List shows execute_anonymous_apex.
          
Variables—Displays the variables and their assigned values that were in scope when the code that generated the selected log entry was run.
          
Execution Overview—Displays statistics for the code being executed, including the execution time and heap size.
        
      
    
    
      
        What Is the Perspective Manager and How Can You Switch Perspectives?
      
      A perspective is a layout of grouped panels. For instance, the predefined Debug perspective displays the Execution Log, Source, and Variables, while the Analysis perspective displays the Stack Tree, Execution Log, Execution Stack, and Execution Overview.
      You can choose a perspective by selecting Debug | Switch Perspectives or Debug | Perspective Manager. Yes, it’s as easy as switching between different communication panels—and much easier than trying to decipher logs from your Mission Specialist, Earth Space Station, and Mars Mission Control all in the same view.
      You can also create your own perspective. Configure your preferred combination of panels to display, and then select Debug | Save Perspective As. Enter a name for your perspective, and then click OK.

    You’re aware that Engine 3 has problems running smoothly at times. Having this engine running at capacity is critical as you steer to avoid asteroid 2014 QO441. But every time you try to run a systems check, you also get information from a depressed robot in your spaceship. It sends garbled reports predicting a robot uprising, increasing the number of lines in your log—and possibly making you miss valuable information.
    You need a way to control the amount of information logged. Luckily for you, the Developer Console does just that with the help of log categories and log levels.
    
      
        Log Categories
      
      A log category is the type of information that is being logged.
      Here are two common log categories.
          
ApexCode, which logs events related to Apex code and includes information about the start and end of an Apex method.
          
Database, which includes logs related to database events, including Database Manipulation Language (DML), SOSL, and SOQL queries (something we get into later).
        
      
    
    
      
        Log Levels and How to Change Them
      
      It seems that Engine 3 is having problems again. As you’re going through the logs to see what could have caused these problems, you see warning messages about the uprising from the melancholy robot.
      One robot does not make an uprising, so you’re not too worried about the warnings. The faulty engine, however, is an urgent concern. What if you lose track of the actual messages from Engine 3 buried in all that log data? Log levels to the rescue!
      Log levels control how much detail is logged for each log category. The following levels are available in the Developer Console, from the least amount of data logged (level = NONE) to the most (level = FINEST).
          NONE
          ERROR
          WARN
          INFO
          DEBUG
          FINE
          FINER
          FINEST
        
      
      Logging levels are cumulative. For instance, if the log level is INFO for an event, log information at the ERROR and WARN levels is also included. But if your log level is ERROR, you get only error messages. You don’t get warning messages or any other log information for that log category.
      The information a log level provides also depends on the log event. Different log events start logging at particular log levels. For instance, some ApexCode events start logging at INFO. If you set ERROR as the log level, you don’t get any log information for those events.
      To get the information you’re looking for, modify the log levels for different events. You want to suppress logging when the robot saves messages about the supposed uprising to the database. So, set the log level for the Database (DB) category to NONE or ERROR.
      You can set these levels by selecting Debug | Change Log Levels.
      
      On the General Trace Settings for You tab, click Add/Change (1). In the Change DebugLevel window, choose the log level for each category. Remember, use log levels judiciously. If your log level is FINEST (2), your code can hit log limits and take longer to run. Don’t worry if you don’t see all the levels when you update the log level for a category. Only the levels that add more logging for the category are listed.
      Fortunately, once you’ve disabled logging for the robot’s warnings you find it easy to identify the problem with Engine 3: Its coolant level is low. You dispatch an engineer to add more coolant. While you’re at it, you ask the engineer to oil the robot’s joints. You hope that the fresh lubricant makes the robot a bit happier.

    Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meets the standards you specify before they can save it. A validation rule can contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “True” or “False.” When the validation rule returns a value of "True", this confirms that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. Validation rules can also include error messages to display to users when they enter invalid values based on specified criteria. Using these rules effectively contributes to quality data. For example, you can ensure that all phone number fields contain a specified format or that discounts applied to certain products never exceed a defined percentage.

      Creating a Validation Rule
    
    
      
        From Setup, go to Object Manager and click Account.
        In the left sidebar, click Validation Rules.
        Click New.
        Enter the following properties for your validation rule:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Rule Name: Account_Number_8_Characters&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Error Condition Formula:LEN( AccountNumber) != 8Copy
        
        Error Message: Account number must be 8 characters long.
        To check your formula for errors, click Check Syntax.
        Click Save to finish.
      
      Here’s how a validation rule’s error message can appear when a user types an incorrect account number format into a field.

    Here are some validation rule examples that you can try out yourself.
    
      
        Account Number Is Numeric
      
      The AND function returns a value of "True" if all values in the formula are true, and a value of "False" if one or more values are false. The ISBLANK function determines if an expression has a value. The ISNUMBER function determines if an expression's value is a number. The NOT function determines if the inverse of an expression is true. In the example, the validation rule determines if an account number is both not blank and not a number. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters a non-numeric value for an account number, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message . &nbsp;
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that the Account Number is numeric if not blank.
            
            
              Formula:
              
                
	AND(
   NOT(ISBLANK(AccountNumber)),
   NOT(ISNUMBER(AccountNumber))
)Copy
                
              
            
            
              Error Message:
              Account Number is not numeric.
            
            
              Error Location:
              Account Number
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Date Must Be in the Current Year
      
      The YEAR function returns the four-digit year of a given date. The TODAY function returns the current date. The &lt;&gt; (Not Equal) operator determines if a value is not equal to another value (if it is either less than or greater than the other value.) In the example, the validation rule determines if the year of a given date is not equal to the year of today’s date. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters a date that is not in the current year, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message.
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that a custom date field contains a date within the current year.
            
            
              Formula:
              YEAR( My_Date__c ) &lt;&gt; YEAR ( TODAY() )
            
            
              Error Message:
              Date must be in the current year.
            
            
              Error Location:
              My Date
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Number Range Validation
      
      In the example, the validation rule determines if the difference between two values (Salary Max and Salary Min) is greater than $20,000. A value of "True" indicates that the data entered by the user contains an invalid value. That is, if the user enters two values whose difference exceeds the $20,000 salary range, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message.
      
        
          
            
              Field
              Value
            
          
          
            
              Description:
              Validates that the range between two custom fields, Salary Min and Salary Max, is no greater than $20,000.
            
            
              Formula:
              
                
(Salary_Max__c - Salary_Min__c) &gt; 20000Copy
                
              
            
            
              Error Message:
              Salary range must be within $20,000. Adjust the Salary Max or Salary Min values.
            
            
              Error Location:
              Salary Max
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Website Extension
      
      The AND function returns a value of "True" if all values in the formula are true, and a value of "False" if one or more values are false. The &lt;&gt; (Not Equal) operator determines if a value is not equal (is either less than or greater than) another value. In the example, if the user enters a website URL with an extension that is not equal to (is either greater than or less than) &nbsp;all six of the valid extensions, the validation rule returns a response of "True" and sends an error message. If the user enters a website URL with an extension that is identical to (is not greater than or less than) one of the valid extensions, the validation rule returns a response of "False" and does not send an error message, because the data the user entered is valid.
      
        
          
            
              Field

      The OR function returns a "True" response if one or more expressions in the formula are true, and returns a "False" response if all expressions are false. The LEN function returns the number of characters in a specified text string. In the example, the validation rule determines if the value that the user entered for a Billing Country code is either one character (instead of the required two), or does not contain one of the valid two-character codes. If either of these conditions is true, the validation rule returns a value of "True" and sends an error message. If the user enters a valid Billing Country code, both expressions in the formula are false: the LEN is not 1, and the data does contain one of the valid values. In this case, the validation rule returns a value of "False" and does not send an error message.

Again, think of our School District Management developer org.
Let’s start with the idea that we have built an application that lists all of the current students in our network of schools. In this application, there are two important things to note.

As the page loads, it reads the URL parameter value and automatically changes the role of that student to the honor roll.
Seems pretty straightforward. You may be wondering, where’s the vulnerability?&nbsp;
Let’s take a look at this scenario again and change it slightly.
This time, imagine that after you logged in to your School District Management org, you decided to browse to another website. While on this website, you click a hyperlink. This hyperlink redirects to a link to www.beststudents.com/promote?user_id=123.

2023-04-04 11:57:32,819 - INFO - Processed paragraph 11 in 2_secure-serverside-development_mitigate-crosssite-request-forgery_content.txt: Successfully performing a CSRF attack is not trivial. It requires the targeted user to visit the attack page while authenticated with the targeted service, which often requires coordinated deception on the part of the attacker (this is most commonly seen in phishing campaigns). If the attack is successfully performed, the impact of it can be severe, ranging from creating or modifying users to deleting data and even to account compromise. So how do you prevent an attacker from launching an attack on your end users?
If you remember from our honor roll example, the malicious website automatically submitted the request to the application containing the URL parameter (UserId) required to successfully submit the request. For this attack to succeed, the attacker had to know the exact name of the parameter—in other words, the attacker had to know the parameter name was “userID” not “id” or “user”—and also supply the associated values.
Consider a slightly different version of the page that has two required URL parameters: userId and token. For this same attack to occur, the attacker again has to correctly guess values for both parameters. But what if you made the token parameter value a random, unique value that changed on every request? This would make it next to impossible for an attacker to guess the current value, preventing the attack. This example is the most common prevention technique for CSRF.

By default, requests made against Salesforce resources have CSRF tokens attached to them. These pseudo-random tokens prevent the reuse and distribution of hyperlinks in order to protect privileged accounts from accidentally making state-changing requests that were not intended.
Beyond this, developers of Lightning applications need to pay attention to how their code is structured to prevent CSRF attacks from occurring. The most simple forms of CSRF attacks use HTTP GET requests with state-changing parameters, like GET mywebsite.com?change_username=”joe”.
By simply avoiding the use of state-changing HTTP GET requests, you can eliminate a large number of CSRF vulnerabilities in your code. When you reach out to a web API, make use of POST or PUT instead when state changes are needed.&nbsp;
There are several other mitigations that can be put in place in your application to prevent CSRF attacks.
When an endpoint is hit in your API, you can validate the origin header. The origin header is set on HTTP GET requests and specifies the URL from which a request originated. If the request is on the forbidden headers list, meaning all major browsers will not allow it to be spoofed via JavaScript—it will always return the correct value unless the request initiates from a nonstandard browser or tool.
When you integrate your Salesforce Lightning application with a third-party application via API, you may desire your own anti-CSRF tokens. These can easily be added to XMLHttpRequests within Lightning by using setRequestHeader() in an HTTP request that looks like this:

    To read a record from Salesforce, you must write a query. Salesforce provides the Salesforce Object Query Language, or SOQL in short, that you can use to read saved records. SOQL is similar to the standard SQL language but is customized for the Lightning Platform.
    
    Because Apex has direct access to Salesforce records that are stored in the database, you can embed SOQL queries in your Apex code and get results in a straightforward fashion. When SOQL is embedded in Apex, it is referred to as inline SOQL.

Account[] accts = [SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account];Copy
    
    
      Prerequisites
      Some queries in this unit expect the org to have accounts and contacts. Before you run the queries, create some sample data.
      
        In the Developer Console, open the Execute Anonymous window from the Debug menu.
        Insert the below snippet in the window and click Execute.
      
      
// Add account and related contact
Account acct = new Account(
    Name='SFDC Computing',
    Phone='(415)555-1212',
    NumberOfEmployees=50,
    BillingCity='San Francisco');
insert acct;
// Once the account is inserted, the sObject will be 
// populated with an ID.
// Get this ID.
ID acctID = acct.ID;
// Add a contact to this account.
Contact con = new Contact(
    FirstName='Carol',
    LastName='Ruiz',
    Phone='(415)555-1212',
    Department='Wingo',
    AccountId=acctID);
insert con;
// Add account with no contact
Account acct2 = new Account(
    Name='The SFDC Query Man',
    Phone='(310)555-1213',
    NumberOfEmployees=50,
    BillingCity='Los Angeles',
    Description='Expert in wing technologies.');
insert acct2;Copy
      
    
    
      Use the Query Editor
      The Developer Console provides the Query Editor console, which enables you to run your SOQL queries and view results. The Query Editor provides a quick way to inspect the database. It is a good way to test your SOQL queries before adding them to your Apex code. When you use the Query Editor, you must supply only the SOQL statement without the Apex code that surrounds it.
      Let’s try running the following SOQL example:
      
        In the Developer Console, click the Query Editor&nbsp; tab.
        Copy and paste the following into the first box under Query Editor, and then click Execute.
      
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM AccountCopy
      
      All account records in your org appear in the Query Results section as rows with fields.
    
    
      
        Basic SOQL Syntax
      
      This is the syntax of a basic SOQL query:
      
SELECT fields FROM ObjectName [WHERE Condition]Copy
      
      The WHERE clause is optional. Let’s start with a very simple query. For example, the following query retrieves accounts and gets Name and Phone fields for each account.
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM AccountCopy
      
      The query has two parts:
      
        
SELECT Name,Phone: This part lists the fields that you would like to retrieve. The fields are specified after the SELECT keyword in a comma-delimited list. Or you can specify only one field, in which case no comma is necessary (e.g. SELECT Phone).
        
FROM Account: This part specifies the standard or custom object that you want to retrieve. In this example, it’s Account. For a custom object called Invoice_Statement, it is Invoice_Statement__c.
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                          
                            Beyond the Basics
                            Unlike other SQL languages, you can’t specify * for all fields. You must specify every field you want to get explicitly. If you try to access a field you haven’t specified in the SELECT clause, you’ll get an error because the field hasn’t been retrieved.
                            You don’t need to specify the Id field in the query as it is always returned in Apex queries, whether it is specified in the query or not. For example: SELECT Id,Phone FROM Account and SELECT Phone FROM Account are equivalent statements. The only time you may want to specify the Id field if it is the only field you’re retrieving because you have to list at least one field: SELECT Id FROM Account. You may want to specify the Id field also when running a query in the Query Editor as the ID field won’t be displayed unless specified.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Filter Query Results with Conditions
      If you have more than one account in the org, they will all be returned. If you want to limit the accounts returned to accounts that fulfill a certain condition, you can add this condition inside the WHERE clause. The following example retrieves only the accounts whose names are SFDC Computing. Note that comparisons on strings are case-insensitive.
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE Name='SFDC Computing'Copy
      
      The WHERE clause can contain multiple conditions that are grouped by using logical operators (AND, OR) and parentheses. For example, this query returns all accounts whose name is SFDC Computing that have more than 25 employees:
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees&gt;25)Copy
      
      This is another example with a more complex condition. This query returns all of these records:
      
        All SFDC Computing accounts
        All accounts with more than 25 employees whose billing city is Los Angeles
      
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' OR (NumberOfEmployees&gt;25 AND BillingCity='Los Angeles'))Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        
                        
                          
                            Beyond the Basics
                            Instead of using the equal operator (=) for comparison, you can perform fuzzy matches by using the LIKE operator. For example, you can retrieve all accounts whose names start with SFDC by using this condition: WHERE Name LIKE 'SFDC%'. The % wildcard character matches any or no character. The _ character in contrast can be used to match just one character.
                          
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Order Query Results
      When a query executes, it returns records from Salesforce in no particular order, so you can’t rely on the order of records in the returned array to be the same each time the query is run. You can however choose to sort the returned record set by adding an ORDER BY clause and specifying the field by which the record set should be sorted. This example sorts all retrieved accounts based on the Name field.
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account ORDER BY NameCopy
      
      The default sort order is in alphabetical order, specified as ASC. The previous statement is equivalent to:
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name ASCCopy
      
      To reverse the order, use the DESC keyword for descending order:
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account ORDER BY Name DESCCopy
      
      You can sort on most fields, including numeric and text fields. You can’t sort on fields like rich text and multi-select picklists.
      Try these SOQL statements in the Query Editor and see how the order of the returned record changes based on the Name field.
    
    
      Limit the Number of Records Returned
      You can limit the number of records returned to an arbitrary number by adding the LIMIT n clause where n is the number of records you want returned. Limiting the result set is handy when you don’t care which records are returned, but you just want to work with a subset of records. For example, this query retrieves the first account that is returned. Notice that the returned value is one account and not an array when using LIMIT 1.
      
Account oneAccountOnly = [SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account LIMIT 1];Copy
      
    
    
      
        Combine All Pieces Together
      
      You can combine the optional clauses in one query, in the following order:
      
SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account 
                   WHERE (Name = 'SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees&gt;25)
                   ORDER BY Name
                   LIMIT 10Copy
      
      Execute the following SOQL query in Apex by using the Execute Anonymous window in the Developer Console. Then inspect the debug statements in the debug log. One sample account should be returned.
      
Account[] accts = [SELECT Name,Phone FROM Account 
                   WHERE (Name='SFDC Computing' AND NumberOfEmployees&gt;25)
                   ORDER BY Name
                   LIMIT 10];
System.debug(accts.size() + ' account(s) returned.');
// Write all account array info
System.debug(accts);Copy
      
    
    
      Access Variables in SOQL Queries
      SOQL statements in Apex can reference Apex code variables and expressions if they are preceded by a colon (:). The use of a local variable within a SOQL statement is called a bind.
      This example shows how to use the targetDepartment variable in the WHERE clause.
      
String targetDepartment = 'Wingo';
Contact[] techContacts = [SELECT FirstName,LastName 
                          FROM Contact WHERE Department=:targetDepartment];Copy
      
    
    
      Query Related Records
      Records in Salesforce can be linked to each other through relationships: lookup relationships or master-detail relationships. For example, the Contact has a lookup relationship to Account. When you create or update a contact, you can associate it with an account. The contacts that are associated with the same account appear in a related list on the account’s page. In the same way you can view related records in the Salesforce user interface, you can query related records in SOQL.
      To get child records related to a parent record, add an inner query for the child records. The FROM clause of the inner query runs against the relationship name, rather than a Salesforce object name. This example contains an inner query to get all contacts that are associated with each returned account. The FROM clause specifies the Contacts relationship, which is a default relationship on Account that links accounts and contacts.
      
SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'Copy
      
      This next example embeds the example SOQL query in Apex and shows how to get the child records from the SOQL result by using the Contacts relationship name on the sObject.
      
Account[] acctsWithContacts = [SELECT Name, (SELECT FirstName,LastName FROM Contacts)
                               FROM Account 
                               WHERE Name = 'SFDC Computing'];
// Get child records
Contact[] cts = acctsWithContacts[0].Contacts;
System.debug('Name of first associated contact: ' 
             + cts[0].FirstName + ', ' + cts[0].LastName);Copy
      
      You can traverse a relationship from a child object (contact) to a field on its parent (Account.Name) by using dot notation. For example, the following Apex snippet queries contact records whose first name is Carol and is able to retrieve the name of Carol’s associated account by traversing the relationship between accounts and contacts.
      
Contact[] cts = [SELECT Account.Name FROM Contact 
                 WHERE FirstName = 'Carol' AND LastName='Ruiz'];
Contact carol = cts[0];
String acctName = carol.Account.Name;
System.debug('Carol\'s account name is ' + acctName);Copy
      
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  The examples in this section are based on standard objects. Custom objects can also be linked together by using custom relationships. Custom relationship names end with the __r suffix. For example, invoice statements are linked to line items through the Line_Items__r relationship on the Invoice_Statement__c custom object.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Query Record in Batches By Using SOQL For Loops
      With a SOQL for loop, you can include a SOQL query within a for loop. The results of a SOQL query can be iterated over within the loop. SOQL for loops use a different method for retrieving records—records are retrieved using efficient chunking with calls to the query and queryMore methods of the SOAP API. By using SOQL for loops, you can avoid hitting the heap size limit.
      SOQL for loops iterate over all of the sObject records returned by a SOQL query. The syntax of a SOQL for loop is either:
for (variable : [soql_query]) {
    code_block
}Copy
        or
for (variable_list : [soql_query]) {
    code_block
}Copy
        
      
      Both &nbsp;variable and &nbsp;variable_list must be of the same type as the sObjects that are returned by the &nbsp;soql_query.
      It is preferable to use the sObject list format of the SOQL for loop as the loop executes once for each batch of 200 sObjects. Doing so enables you to work on batches of records and perform DML operations in batch, which helps avoid reaching governor limits.
      
insert new Account[]{new Account(Name = 'for loop 1'), 
                     new Account(Name = 'for loop 2'), 
                     new Account(Name = 'for loop 3')};
// The sObject list format executes the for loop once per returned batch
// of records
Integer i=0;
Integer j=0;
for (Account[] tmp : [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'for loop _']) {
    j = tmp.size();
    i++;
}
System.assertEquals(3, j); // The list should have contained the three accounts
                       // named 'yyy'
System.assertEquals(1, i); // Since a single batch can hold up to 200 records and,

    Queueable Apex
  
  
    Released in Winter '15, Queueable Apex is essentially a superset of future methods with some extra #awesomesauce. We took the simplicity of future methods and the power of Batch Apex and mixed them together to form Queueable Apex! It gives you a class structure that the platform serializes for you, a simplified interface without start and finish methods and even allows you to utilize more than just primitive arguments! It is called by a simple System.enqueueJob() method, which returns a job ID that you can monitor. It beats sliced bread hands down!
    Queueable Apex allows you to submit jobs for asynchronous processing similar to future methods with the following additional benefits: 
      
        Non-primitive types: Your Queueable class can contain member variables of non-primitive data types, such as sObjects or custom Apex types. Those objects can be accessed when the job executes.
        Monitoring: When you submit your job by invoking the System.enqueueJob() method, the method returns the ID of the AsyncApexJob record. You can use this ID to identify your job and monitor its progress, either through the Salesforce user interface in the Apex Jobs page, or programmatically by querying your record from AsyncApexJob.
        Chaining jobs: You can chain one job to another job by starting a second job from a running job. Chaining jobs is useful if you need to do some sequential processing.

    Because queueable methods are functionally equivalent to future methods, most of the time you’ll probably want to use queueable instead of future methods. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you should go back and refactor all your future methods right now.
    Another reason to use future methods instead of queueable is when your functionality is sometimes executed synchronously, and sometimes asynchronously. It’s much easier to refactor a method in this manner than converting to a queueable class. This is handy when you discover that part of your existing code needs to be moved to async execution. You can simply create a similar future method that wraps your synchronous method like so:
    
@future
static void myFutureMethod(List&lt;String&gt; params) {
    // call synchronous method
    mySyncMethod(params);
}Copy

    To use Queueable Apex, simply implement the Queueable interface.
    
public class SomeClass implements Queueable {
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // awesome code here
    }
}Copy
    
    
      
        Sample Code
      
      A common scenario is to take some set of sObject records, execute some processing such as making a callout to an external REST endpoint or perform some calculations and then update them in the database asynchronously. Because @future methods are limited to primitive data types (or arrays or collections of primitives), queueable Apex is an ideal choice. The following code takes a collection of Account records, sets the parentId for each record, and then updates the records in the database.
      
public class UpdateParentAccount implements Queueable {
    private List&lt;Account&gt; accounts;
    private ID parent;
    public UpdateParentAccount(List&lt;Account&gt; records, ID id) {
        this.accounts = records;
        this.parent = id;
    }
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        for (Account account : accounts) {
          account.parentId = parent;
          // perform other processing or callout
        }
        update accounts;
    }
}Copy
      
      To add this class as a job on the queue, execute the following code:
      
// find all accounts in ‘NY’
List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = [select id from account where billingstate = ‘NY’];
// find a specific parent account for all records
Id parentId = [select id from account where name = 'ACME Corp'][0].Id;
// instantiate a new instance of the Queueable class
UpdateParentAccount updateJob = new UpdateParentAccount(accounts, parentId);
// enqueue the job for processing
ID jobID = System.enqueueJob(updateJob);Copy
      
      After you submit your queueable class for execution, the job is added to the queue and will be processed when system resources become available.
      You can use the new job ID to monitor progress, either through the Apex Jobs page or programmatically by querying AsyncApexJob:
      
SELECT Id, Status, NumberOfErrors FROM AsyncApexJob WHERE Id = :jobIDCopy

    The following code sample shows how to test the execution of a queueable job in a test method. It looks very similar to Batch Apex testing. To ensure that the queueable process runs within the test method, the job is submitted to the queue between the Test.startTest and Test.stopTest block. The system executes all asynchronous processes started in a test method synchronously after the Test.stopTest statement. Next, the test method verifies the results of the queueable job by querying the account records that the job updated.
    
@isTest
public class UpdateParentAccountTest {
    @testSetup
    static void setup() {
        List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = new List&lt;Account&gt;();
        // add a parent account
        accounts.add(new Account(name='Parent'));
        // add 100 child accounts
        for (Integer i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            accounts.add(new Account(
                name='Test Account'+i
            ));
        }
        insert accounts;
    }
    static testmethod void testQueueable() {
        // query for test data to pass to queueable class
        Id parentId = [select id from account where name = 'Parent'][0].Id;
        List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = [select id, name from account where name like 'Test Account%'];
        // Create our Queueable instance
        UpdateParentAccount updater = new UpdateParentAccount(accounts, parentId);
        // startTest/stopTest block to force async processes to run
        Test.startTest();
        System.enqueueJob(updater);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Validate the job ran. Check if record have correct parentId now
        System.assertEquals(100, [select count() from account where parentId = :parentId]);
    }
}Copy

    One of the best features of Queueable Apex is job chaining. If you ever need to run jobs sequentially, Queueable Apex could make your life much easier. To chain a job to another job, submit the second job from the execute() method of your queueable class. You can add only one job from an executing job, which means that only one child job can exist for each parent job. For example, if you have a second class called SecondJob that implements the Queueable interface, you can add this class to the queue in the execute() method as follows:
    
public class FirstJob implements Queueable {
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // Awesome processing logic here
        // Chain this job to next job by submitting the next job
        System.enqueueJob(new SecondJob());
    }
}Copy
    
    Once again, testing has a slightly different pattern. You can’t chain queueable jobs in an Apex test, doing so results in an error. To avoid nasty errors, you can check if Apex is running in test context by calling Test.isRunningTest() before chaining jobs.

    Queueable Apex is a great new tool but there are a few things to watch out for: 
      
        The execution of a queued job counts once against the shared limit for asynchronous Apex method executions.
        You can add up to 50 jobs to the queue with System.enqueueJob in a single transaction.
        When chaining jobs, you can add only one job from an executing job with System.enqueueJob, which means that only one child job can exist for each parent queueable job. Starting multiple child jobs from the same queueable job is a no-no.
        No limit is enforced on the depth of chained jobs, which means that you can chain one job to another job and repeat this process with each new child job to link it to a new child job. However, for Developer Edition and Trial orgs, the maximum stack depth for chained jobs is 5, which means that you can chain jobs four times and the maximum number of jobs in the chain is 5, including the initial parent queueable job.

    The moment your spaceship starts sounding system errors, you have to head straight to the logs to figure out what went wrong and where.
    Similarly, when your Apex code is causing errors, has performance issues, or isn’t producing the desired results, your first step is to identify the problem using your debug log. Combing line by line through the entire log is a tedious task. That’s where checkpoints come in handy! Checkpoints show you snapshots of what’s happening in your Apex code at particular points during execution.
    You can set up to five checkpoints in your Apex code. Checkpoints aren’t available for Visualforce markup.
    Let’s set a checkpoint in the EmailMissionSpecialistclass that we created earlier.
        Select File | Open, and open the EmailMissionSpecialist class.
        Select Debug | Change Log Levels.
        In the General Trace Settings for You section, click Add/Change.
        Set the ApexCode log level to FINEST. Note: To set checkpoints, you need the View All Data user permission. To generate results using checkpoints, run code using execute anonymous, or set a DEVELOPER_LOG trace flag on yourself. The trace flag must have a log level for Apex of INFO or higher.
        To save your changes, click Done.
        To exit the Change Log Levels dialog box, click Done.
      
    
    When your code is displayed in the source code editor, you can see line numbers on the left side. Click the line number for inspectResults(results);. A red dot (1) appears, indicating that a checkpoint has been created.
    
    Now you can execute your code and analyze it using the Checkpoints tab.

    Select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window. Enter the following code and execute it. Be sure to replace Enter your email address with your email address.
    
EmailMissionSpecialist em = new EmailMissionSpecialist();
em.sendMail('Enter your email address', 'Flight Path Change', 
   'Mission Control 123: Your flight path has been changed to avoid collision '
   + 'with asteroid 2014 QO441.');Copy
    
    After you run the Apex code successfully, open your debug log and click the Checkpoints tab to see the results.
    
    
      
        The Checkpoints table displays the namespace, class, and line number of each checkpoint. It also shows you the date and time when each checkpoint was created.
        The Checkpoint Locations table displays the file name, line number, and iterations captured by the selected checkpoint.
      
    
    Double-click a checkpoint in the Checkpoints table to see the captured results in the Checkpoint Inspector. Now the fun begins!

Heap—Displays all objects present in memory at the line of code where your checkpoint was executed.
        
Symbols—Displays all symbols in memory in tree view.
      
    
    
      
        Heap Tab
      
      The Heap tab includes some great panels for debugging, like the Types panel. This panel shows how many objects were instantiated and the memory they consumed in bytes. Let’s look at the details captured by the checkpoint you set.
          Under Types, click Messaging.SingleEmailMessage.
          Under Instances, click any instance of this object type.
          Under State, view the object’s fields and their values.

Let's look at how the components nested at the UI level in a diagram.

&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;header class="header"&gt;Select a Bike&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;section class="content"&gt;
        &lt;div class="columns"&gt;
        &lt;main class="main" &gt;
            &lt;c-list onproductselected={handleProductSelected}&gt;&lt;/c-list&gt;
        &lt;/main&gt;
        &lt;aside class="sidebar-second"&gt;
            &lt;c-detail product-id={selectedProductId}&gt;&lt;/c-detail&gt;
        &lt;/aside&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
If you look in detail.html, you see conditional rendering(if:true={product} and if:false={product}). If nothing has been chosen from the list, then what's displayed is a message asking the user to choose something. If something is chosen, it displays the bike information.
&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;template if:true={product}&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;{product.fields.Name.value}&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="price"&gt;{product.fields.MSRP__c.displayValue}&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="description"&gt;{product.fields.Description__c.value}&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;img class="product-img" src={product.fields.Picture_URL__c.value}&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;lightning-badge label={product.fields.Material__c.value}&gt;&lt;/lightning-badge&gt;
                &lt;lightning-badge label={product.fields.Level__c.value}&gt;&lt;/lightning-badge&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;lightning-badge label={product.fields.Category__c.value}&gt;&lt;/lightning-badge&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;template if:false={product}&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;Select a bike&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
The list component renders several tile(c-tile) components, one for each bike in the data. This nesting is achieved in the HTML for each parent component. For example, the list component has the following HTML, including the tile component as c-tile.
&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;template for:each={bikes} for:item="bike"&gt;
            &lt;c-tile
                key={bike.fields.Id.value}
                product={bike}
                ontileclick={handleTileClick}&gt;
            &lt;/c-tile&gt;
        &lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
Notice how each iteration of the bike item spawns a new tile component. Simply including the c-tile component tag makes each tile component its child. The div class definition “container” is used for styling, so you can control the arrangement of tiles. If you look at list.css, you see that it wraps the content.
.container {
   display: flex;
   flex-direction: row;
   flex-wrap: wrap;
}Copy
The parent/child relationship is important, not only for the design of the app, but also for event handling.
Let's dig a little deeper into the event handling.

The child component dispatches the event and the parent component listens for it. Dispatching the event includes creating an event object the child can pass to the parent component. The parent has a handler to respond to the event.
For example, a child component like this one contains a nextHandler() method that creates a simple event object using CustomEvent() and dispatches the event type 'next' when the user clicks a Next button.// todoItem.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
...
    nextHandler() {

2023-04-04 12:04:32,020 - INFO - Processed paragraph 25 in 3_lightning-web-components-basics_handle-events-in-lightning-web-components_content.txt: Information can be passed down using public properties and public methods.
You can make a component property public by prefacing it with the @api decorator. Then, set the public property by an external component.
For example, if the c-todo-item child component has the following:
// todoItem.js
import { LightningElement, api } from 'lwc';
export default class TodoItem extends LightningElement {
   @api itemName;
}Copy
Set the value from the parent with the following:
&lt;!-- todoApp.html --&gt;
&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;c-todo-item item-name="Milk"&gt;&lt;/c-todo-item&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
Notice that the itemName variable gets set using the kebab case attribute item-name. Property names in JavaScript are in camel case while HTML attribute names are in kebab case (dash-separated) to match HTML standards. The item-name attribute in markup maps to the itemName JavaScript property.
Public properties are great solutions for passing down primitive values, simple objects, and arrays.
Also, you can use getters &amp; setters to execute some logic when properties are get or set. And remember, annotate them with the @api decorator to make them public for other components.
Similarly, you can create public methods that are callable from a parent component. Create a public method in the child component by defining it with the @api decorator, then call it from the parent component.
Let's say that we have a child component like this one.
// videoPlayer.js
import { LightningElement, api } from 'lwc';
export default class VideoPlayer extends LightningElement {
   @api
   play() {
       // Play music!
   }
}Copy
When the c-video-player component is included in a parent component, we can invoke the method from the parent component like this:
// methodCaller.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
export default class MethodCaller extends LightningElement {
   handlePlay() {
      this.template.querySelector('c-video-player').play();
   }
}Copy
We defined a method handlePlay() that fires the event. Then we use the querySelector() DOM method to search for a DOM element called c-video-player and invoke its public method.

2023-04-04 12:04:34,882 - INFO - Processed paragraph 27 in 3_lightning-web-components-basics_handle-events-in-lightning-web-components_content.txt: So our selector app needs to handle one type of event—the user clicking a tile. When this happens, the detail component should re-render with the information from the related tile. You can handle events in HTML (add an event listener in the template) or JavaScript (write an event listener function). We recommend using the HTML approach, as follows.
Each tile component listens for the user click because the tile component's HTML (tile.html) contains an onclick event listener.
&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;a onclick={tileClick}&gt;
            &lt;div class="title"&gt;{product.fields.Name.value}&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;img class="product-img" src={product.fields.Picture_URL__c.value}&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;Copy
When a user clicks one of the tile instances in the UI, the onclick listener calls the handler function tileClick in the tile.js JavaScript file.
import { LightningElement, api } from 'lwc';
export default class Tile extends LightningElement {
    @api product;
    tileClick() {
        const event = new CustomEvent('tileclick', {
            // detail contains only primitives
            detail: this.product.fields.Id.value
        });
        // Fire the event from c-tile
        this.dispatchEvent(event);

      Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) is a Salesforce search language that is used to perform text searches in records. Use SOSL to search fields across multiple standard and custom object records in Salesforce. SOSL is similar to Apache Lucene.
      
      Adding SOSL queries to Apex is simple—you can embed SOSL queries directly in your Apex code. When SOSL is embedded in Apex, it is referred to as inline SOSL
2023-04-04 12:06:37,127 - INFO - Related goals: 8
2023-04-04 12:06:41,967 - INFO - Processed paragraph 4 in 4_apex_database_apex_database_sosl_content.txt: This is an example of a SOSL query that searches for accounts and contacts that have any fields with the word 'SFDC'.
    
List&lt;List&lt;SObject&gt;&gt; searchList = [FIND 'SFDC' IN ALL FIELDS 
                                      RETURNING Account(Name), Contact(FirstName,LastName)];Copy
    
      Differences and Similarities Between SOQL and SOSL
      Like SOQL, SOSL allows you to search your organization’s records for specific information. Unlike SOQL, which can only query one standard or custom object at a time, a single SOSL query can search all objects.
      Another difference is that SOSL matches fields based on a word match while SOQL performs an exact match by default (when not using wildcards). For example, searching for 'Digital' in SOSL returns records whose field values are 'Digital' or 'The Digital Company', but SOQL returns only records with field values of 'Digital'.
      SOQL and SOSL are two separate languages with different syntax. Each language has a distinct use case:
      
        Use SOQL to retrieve records for a single object.
        Use SOSL to search fields across multiple objects. SOSL queries can search most text fields on an object.
      
    
    
      Prerequisites
      Some queries in this unit expect the org to have accounts and contacts. If you haven’t created the sample data in the SOQL unit, create sample data in this unit. Otherwise, you can skip creating the sample data in this section.
      
        In the Developer Console, open the Execute Anonymous window from the Debug menu.
        Insert the below snippet in the window and click Execute.
      
      
// Add account and related contact
Account acct = new Account(
    Name='SFDC Computing',
    Phone='(415)555-1212',
    NumberOfEmployees=50,
    BillingCity='San Francisco');
insert acct;
// Once the account is inserted, the sObject will be 
// populated with an ID.
// Get this ID.
ID acctID = acct.ID;
// Add a contact to this account.
Contact con = new Contact(
    FirstName='Carol',
    LastName='Ruiz',
    Phone='(415)555-1212',
    Department='Wingo',
    AccountId=acctID);
insert con;
// Add account with no contact
Account acct2 = new Account(
    Name='The SFDC Query Man',
    Phone='(310)555-1213',
    NumberOfEmployees=50,
    BillingCity='Los Angeles',
    Description='Expert in wing technologies.');
insert acct2;Copy
      
    
    
      Use the Query Editor
      The Developer Console provides the Query Editor console, which enables you to run SOSL queries and view results. The Query Editor provides a quick way to inspect the database. It is a good way to test your SOSL queries before adding them to your Apex code. When you use the Query Editor, you need to supply only the SOSL statement without the Apex code that surrounds it.
      Let’s try running the following SOSL example:
      
        In the Developer Console, click the Query Editor&nbsp; tab.
        Copy and paste the following into the first box under Query Editor, and then click Execute.
      
      
FIND {Wingo} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account(Name), Contact(FirstName,LastName,Department)Copy
      
      All account and contact records in your org that satisfy the criteria will display in the Query Results section as rows with fields. The results are grouped in tabs for each object (account or contact). The SOSL query returns records that have fields whose values match Wingo. Based on our sample data, only one contact has a field with the value Wingo, so this contact is returned..
      
        
          
            
              
              
                
                  Note
                  The search query in the Query Editor and the API must be enclosed within curly brackets ({Wingo}). In contrast, in Apex the search query is enclosed within single quotes ('Wingo').
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Basic SOSL Syntax
      
      SOSL allows you to specify the following search criteria:
          Text expression (single word or a phrase) to search for
          Scope of fields to search
          List of objects and fields to retrieve
          Conditions for selecting rows in the source objects
        
      
      This is the syntax of a basic SOSL query in Apex:&nbsp;
      
FIND 'SearchQuery' [IN SearchGroup] [RETURNING ObjectsAndFields]Copy
      
      Remember that in the Query Editor and API, the syntax is slightly different:
FIND {SearchQuery} [IN SearchGroup] [RETURNING ObjectsAndFields]Copy
      SearchQuery is the text to search for (a single word or a phrase). Search terms can be grouped with logical operators (AND, OR) and parentheses. Also, search terms can include wildcard characters (*, ?). The * wildcard matches zero or more characters at the middle or end of the search term. The ? wildcard matches only one character at the middle or end of the search term.
      Text searches are case-insensitive. For example, searching for Customer, customer, or CUSTOMER all return the same results.
      SearchGroup is optional. It is the scope of the fields to search. If not specified, the default search scope is all fields. SearchGroup can take one of the following values.
      
        ALL FIELDS
        NAME FIELDS
        EMAIL FIELDS
        PHONE FIELDS
        SIDEBAR FIELDS
      
      ObjectsAndFields is optional. It is the information to return in the search result—a list of one or more sObjects and, within each sObject, list of one or more fields, with optional values to filter against. If not specified, the search results contain the IDs of all objects found.
    
    
      Single Words and Phrases
      A SearchQuery contains two types of text:
      
        
Single Word— single word, such as test or hello. Words in the SearchQuery are delimited by spaces, punctuation, and changes from letters to digits (and vice-versa). Words are always case insensitive.
        
Phrase— collection of words and spaces surrounded by double quotes such as "john smith". Multiple words can be combined together with logic and grouping operators to form a more complex query.
      
    
    
      Search Examples
      To learn about how SOSL search works, let’s play with different search strings and see what the output is based on our sample data. This table lists various example search strings and the SOSL search results.
      
        
          
            
              Search in all fields for:
              Search Description
              Matched Records and Fields
            
          
          
            
              The Query
              This search returns all records whose fields contain both words: The and Query, in any location of the text. The order of words in the search term doesn’t matter.
              Account: The SFDC Query Man (Name field matched)
            
            
              Wingo OR Man
              This search uses the OR logical operator. It returns records with fields containing the word Wingo or records with fields containing the word Man.
              Contact: Carol Ruiz, Department: 'Wingo'Account: The SFDC Query Man (Name field matched)
              
            
            
              1212
              This search returns all records whose fields contain the word 1212. Phone fields that end with -1212 are matched because 1212 is considered a word when delimited by the dash.
              Account: The SFDC Query Man, Phone: '(415)555-1212'Contact: Carol Ruiz, Phone: '(415)555-1212'
              
            
            
              wing*
              This is a wildcard search. This search returns all records that have a field value starting with wing.

        SOSL Apex Example
      
      This example shows how to run a SOSL query in Apex. First, the variable soslFindClause&nbsp; is assigned the search query, which consists of two terms (Wingo and SFDC) combined by the OR logical operator. The SOSL query references this local variable by preceding it with a colon, also called binding. The resulting SOSL query searches for Wingo or SFDC in any field. This example returns all the sample accounts because they each have a field containing one of the words. The SOSL search results are returned in a list of lists. Each list contains an array of the returned records. In this case, the list has two elements. At index 0, the list contains the array of accounts. At index 1, the list contains the array of contacts.
      Execute this snippet in the Execute Anonymous window of the Developer Console. Next, inspect the debug log to verify that all records are returned.
      
String soslFindClause = 'Wingo OR SFDC';
List&lt;List&lt;sObject&gt;&gt; searchList = [FIND :soslFindClause IN ALL FIELDS
                    RETURNING Account(Name),Contact(FirstName,LastName,Department)];
Account[] searchAccounts = (Account[])searchList[0];
Contact[] searchContacts = (Contact[])searchList[1];
System.debug('Found the following accounts.');
for (Account a : searchAccounts) {
    System.debug(a.Name);
}
System.debug('Found the following contacts.');
for (Contact c : searchContacts) {
    System.debug(c.LastName + ', ' + c.FirstName);
}Copy
      
    
    
      
        Tell Me More...
      
      You can filter, reorder, and limit the returned results of a SOSL query. Because SOSL queries can return multiple sObjects, those filters are applied within each sObject inside the RETURNING clause.
      You can filter SOSL results by adding conditions in the WHERE clause for an object. For example, this results in only accounts whose industry is Apparel to be returned: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry WHERE Industry='Apparel').
      Likewise, ordering results for one sObject is supported by adding ORDER BY for an object. For example this causes the returned accounts to be ordered by the Name field: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry ORDER BY Name).
      The number of returned records can be limited to a subset of records. This example limits the returned accounts to 10 only: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry LIMIT 10).

    Scheduled Apex
  
  
    The Apex Scheduler lets you delay execution so that you can run Apex classes at a specified time. This is ideal for daily or weekly maintenance tasks using Batch Apex. To take advantage of the scheduler, write an Apex class that implements the Schedulable interface, and then schedule it for execution on a specific schedule.

2023-04-04 12:08:22,381 - INFO - Processed paragraph 6 in 4_asynchronous_apex_async_apex_scheduled_content.txt: Scheduled Apex Syntax
  
  
    To invoke Apex classes to run at specific times, first implement the Schedulable interface for the class. Then, schedule an instance of the class to run at a specific time using the System.schedule() method.
    
public class SomeClass implements Schedulable {
    public void execute(SchedulableContext ctx) {
        // awesome code here
    }
}Copy
    
    The class implements the Schedulable interface and must implement the only method that this interface contains, which is the execute() method.
    The parameter of this method is a SchedulableContext object. After a class has been scheduled, a CronTrigger object is created that represents the scheduled job. It provides a getTriggerId() method that returns the ID of a CronTrigger API object.
    
      
        Sample Code
      
      This class queries for open opportunities that should have closed by the current date, and creates a task on each one to remind the owner to update the opportunity.
      
public class RemindOpptyOwners implements Schedulable {
    public void execute(SchedulableContext ctx) {
        List&lt;Opportunity&gt; opptys = [SELECT Id, Name, OwnerId, CloseDate
            FROM Opportunity
            WHERE IsClosed = False AND
            CloseDate &lt; TODAY];
        // Create a task for each opportunity in the list
        TaskUtils.remindOwners(opptys);
    }
}Copy
      
      You can schedule your class to run either programmatically or from the Apex Scheduler UI.

2023-04-04 12:08:55,841 - INFO - Processed paragraph 8 in 4_asynchronous_apex_async_apex_scheduled_content.txt: Using the System.Schedule Method
  
  
    After you implement a class with the Schedulable interface, use the System.schedule() method to execute it. The System.schedule() method uses the user's timezone for the basis of all schedules, but runs in system mode—all classes are executed, whether or not the user has permission to execute the class.
    
      
        
          
            
            
              
                Use extreme care if you’re planning to schedule a class from a trigger. You must be able to guarantee that the trigger won’t add more scheduled job classes than the limit. In particular, consider API bulk updates, import wizards, mass record changes through the user interface, and all cases where more than one record can be updated at a time.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    The System.schedule() method takes three arguments: a name for the job, a CRON expression used to represent the time and date the job is scheduled to run, and an instance of a class that implements the Schedulable interface.
    
RemindOpptyOwners reminder = new RemindOpptyOwners();
// Seconds Minutes Hours Day_of_month Month Day_of_week optional_year
String sch = '20 30 8 10 2 ?';
String jobID = System.schedule('Remind Opp Owners', sch, reminder);Copy
    
    For more information on the CRON expression used for scheduling, see the “Using the System.Schedule Method” section in Apex Scheduler.

    Just like with the other async methods we’ve covered so far, with Scheduled Apex you must also ensure that the scheduled job is finished before testing against the results. To do this, use startTest() and stopTest() again around the System.schedule() method, to ensure processing finishes before continuing your test.

    Scheduled Apex has a number of items you need to be aware of (see Apex Scheduler in the Resources section for a complete list when you have time), but in general: 
      
        You can only have 100 scheduled Apex jobs at one time and there are maximum number of scheduled Apex executions per a 24-hour period. See Execution Governors and Limits in the Resources section for details.
        Use extreme care if you’re planning to schedule a class from a trigger. You must be able to guarantee that the trigger won’t add more scheduled jobs than the limit.
        Synchronous Web service callouts are not supported from scheduled Apex. To be able to make callouts, make an asynchronous callout by placing the callout in a method annotated with @future(callout=true) and call this method from scheduled Apex. However, if your scheduled Apex executes a batch job, callouts are supported from the batch class.

   Lastname='Sunrise',
   Phone='(554)623-1212',
   Department= 'Specialty Crisis Management',
   Title='Control Engineer - Specialty - Radiators',
   Email='psunrise@trailhead.com');
insert contact3;CopyNow we can use the Query Editor to write and execute a SOQL query to find these Control Engineers. SOQL queries search for data in specific objects. You can add an optional condition in the WHERE clause to narrow down your search.
          Enter the following query in the Query Editor tab.SELECT Name, Phone, Email, Title FROM Contact
                                 WHERE (Department = 'Specialty Crisis Management')Copy
          
          Click Execute.
        
      
      The results display the details of the contacts who work in the Specialty Crisis Management department.
      
      You can use another SOQL query to find contacts in other departments, or to see whether anyone else has created records for more Control Engineers. To rerun a query, click Refresh Grid in the Query Results panel.
      A SOQL query that you execute using Apex code is called an inline SOQL query. Let’s see how you can use the Developer Console to search for contacts working in the Specialty Crisis Management department using an inline SOQL query.
      This time, let’s also try ordering the results alphabetically by name.
          Select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
          Enter the following code.Contact[] theseContacts = [SELECT Name, Phone, Email, Description FROM Contact
                           WHERE (Department='Specialty Crisis Management')
                           ORDER BY Name];
// Log a count of how many contacts were found
System.debug(theseContacts.size() + ' contact(s) returned.');
// Log all values in the array of contacts
System.debug(theseContacts);Copy
          
          After the code has executed, open the log.
          To view only the USER_DEBUG messages, select Debug Only. The results show the number of accounts returned and the contact details in alphabetical order.

      SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) is a language that performs text searches in records. Unlike SOQL, SOSL can query multiple types of objects at the same time. SOSL can also use a word match to match fields, while SOQL needs the exact phrase.
      When you run a SOSL search for contact records using the word “Crisis,” your search looks through all contact fields and returns any record containing that word. But if you try the same in a SOQL query, you need to specify the fields to search and a complete word or phrase to search for. You can also use LIKE or wildcards to narrow down SOQL or SOSL searches.
    
    
      
        Execute a SOSL Search
      
      
        
          In the Query Editor tab, enter the following SOSL query. Notice that only the partial name of the department Specialty Crisis Management is included in the query.FIND {Crisis} IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email, Title)Copy
          
          Execute the query, and then observe the results in the Search Results pane.&nbsp;

You can create a style sheet in the CSS file, and it's automatically applied to the corresponding HTML file.
Lightning Web Components encapsulates components, keeping them separate from the global DOM. We do this through a mechanism called Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM is a common implementation that allows a component's elements to live in a “sub tree” of the DOM (learn more about Shadow DOM in the link provided in the Resources section). The component can keep its appearance and behavior within other apps or as a child of another component.
For example, let's set the price of a bike to display as bold, green text. Add the following .price entry to the detail.css file.

Lightning web components that live in Lightning Experience or in the Salesforce mobile application can use SLDS without any import statements or static resources.
For example, you can use the SLDS heading styles to give the detail component text that looks more like the standard Lightning text. Update the detail.html file to use the slds-text-heading_small and slds-text-heading_medium font settings as follows.&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;template if:true={product}&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;div class="slds-text-heading_small"&gt;{product.fields.Name.value}&lt;/div&gt;

We'd love to go into more detail, but this module already covers a lot of ground. See Resources at the end of this unit to learn more about additional tools and techniques for creating Lightning components that will make your mobile users happy.
While we're setting mobile aside for now, we strongly recommend that, when you start developing “real” Lightning components, you do the opposite. Consider mobile details and designs, right from the start. With SLDS and our mobile preview tools, it's easy to build for both mobile and desktop, together from the word go.
If you don't mind us “going meta,” this module is an example of the danger of not considering mobile early. When we received feedback that the Bike Selection app didn't look good on mobile devices, we jumped at the chance to make some changes, because we thought it would be just a little bit of work. But even though the app's markup is clean and semantically well thought out, we've decided that retrofitting mobile onto it isn't the right thing to do. We want to rework not just the markup, but also the explanations of it, and the hands-on challenges. And, indeed, the very structure and flow of this module! It's more work now, because we didn't do a little work up front. 
And, sometimes that's OK! Every technology system implementation involves trade-offs. You need to make the right trade-offs for your teams and projects. Keep this trade-off in mind for your projects. Forewarned is forearmed.

    Monitoring Asynchronous Jobs
  
  
    The great thing about async jobs is that they work silently in the background. The tough thing about async jobs is that they work silently in the background. Luckily there are a few ways to monitor what is going on with your jobs under the covers.
    You can monitor the status of all jobs in the Salesforce user interface. From Setup, enter Jobs in the Quick Find box, then select Apex Jobs.
    The Apex Jobs page shows all asynchronous Apex jobs with information about each job’s execution. The following screenshot shows one future method job and two completed batch jobs for the same Batch Apex class.
    
    If you have many batch jobs, use the Batch Jobs page to view only batch jobs. To open the Apex Batch Jobs page, click the link at the top of the Apex Jobs page. Use the slider in the Apex Batch Jobs page to select a specific date range and narrow down the list of batch jobs displayed. You can view past jobs that haven’t been deleted yet. The Batch Jobs page groups jobs by the batch class.
    
    Click More Info next to a class ID you’re interested in to find out details about the jobs executed for that class. This image shows the popup that displays after clicking More Info. This batch class has two jobs that executed successfully.
    
    You can also monitor the status of Apex jobs in the Apex Flex Queue, and reorder them to control which jobs are processed first. From Setup, enter Jobs in the Quick Find box, then select Apex Flex Queue.
    
      
        Monitoring Future Jobs
      
      Future jobs show up on the Apex Jobs page like any other jobs. However, future jobs are not part of the flex queue currently.
      You can query AsyncApexJob to find your future job, but there’s a caveat. Since kicking off a future job does not return an ID, you have to filter on some other field such as MethodName, or JobType, to find your job. There are a few sample SOQL queries in this Stack Exchange post&nbsp; that might help.
    
    
      
        Monitoring Queued Jobs with SOQL
      
      To query information about your submitted job, perform a SOQL query on AsyncApexJob by filtering on the job ID that the System.enqueueJob() method returns.
      
AsyncApexJob jobInfo = [SELECT Status, NumberOfErrors
    FROM AsyncApexJob WHERE Id = :jobID];Copy
      
    
    
      
        Monitoring Queue Jobs with the Flex Queue
      
      The Apex Flex queue enables you to submit up to 100 batch jobs for execution. Any jobs that are submitted for execution are in holding status and are placed in the Apex Flex queue. Up to 100 batch jobs can be in the holding status.
      Jobs are processed first-in first-out—in the order in which they’re submitted. You can look at the current queue order and shuffle the queue, so that you could move an important job to the front, or less important ones to the back.
      When system resources become available, the system picks up the next job from the top of the Apex Flex queue and moves it to the batch job queue. The system can process up to five queued or active jobs simultaneously for each organization. The status of these moved jobs changes from Holding to Queued. Queued jobs get executed when the system is ready to process new jobs. Like other jobs, you can monitor queued jobs in the Apex Jobs page.
    
    
      
        Monitoring Scheduled Jobs
      
      After an Apex job has been scheduled, you can obtain more information about it by running a SOQL query on CronTrigger. The following sample queries the number of times the job has run, and the date and time when the job is scheduled to run again. It uses a jobID variable which is returned from the System.schedule() method.
      
CronTrigger ct = [SELECT TimesTriggered, NextFireTime FROM CronTrigger WHERE Id = :jobID];Copy
      
      If you’re performing this query inside the execute method of your schedulable class, you can obtain the ID of the current job by calling getTriggerId() on the SchedulableContext argument variable.
      
public class DoAwesomeStuff implements Schedulable {
    public void execute(SchedulableContext sc) {
        // some awesome code
        CronTrigger ct = [SELECT TimesTriggered, NextFireTime FROM CronTrigger WHERE Id = :sc.getTriggerId()];
    }
}Copy
      
      You can also get the job’s name and the job’s type from the CronJobDetail record associated with the CronTrigger record. To do so, use the CronJobDetail relationship when performing a query on CronTrigger. This example retrieves the most recent CronTrigger record with the job name and type from CronJobDetail.
      
CronTrigger job = [SELECT Id, CronJobDetail.Id, CronJobDetail.Name, CronJobDetail.JobType FROM CronTrigger ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1];Copy
      
      Alternatively, you can query CronJobDetail directly to get the job’s name and type. The following example gets the job’s name and type for the CronTrigger record queried in the previous example. The corresponding CronJobDetail record ID is obtained by the CronJobDetail.Id expression on the CronTrigger record.
      
CronJobDetail ctd = [SELECT Id, Name, JobType FROM CronJobDetail WHERE Id = :job.CronJobDetail.Id];Copy
      
      And lastly, to obtain the total count of all Apex scheduled jobs, excluding all other scheduled job types, perform the following query. Note the value '7' is specified for the job type, which corresponds to the scheduled Apex job type. See CronJobDetail in the Resources section for a list of all types.
      
SELECT COUNT() FROM CronTrigger WHERE CronJobDetail.JobType = '7’Copy

First, let’s briefly go over what exactly comprises the Lightning Platform. One of the things that separates the platform from other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings is that it relies on a metadata-driven architecture. Everything, including the code, configuration, and apps, is specified as metadata.

Well, the Lightning Platform works differently. The Lightning Platform is tightly integrated with the database. You also get all sorts of things, like user interface, security, and reporting, built right in with the platform. This integration is what lets you build apps super fast.

On the Lightning Platform, you don’t have to worry about setting up nodes or management tasks. You don’t have to worry about upgrading, tuning, or scaling anything. To be honest, you probably won’t miss all that added complexity and responsibility, because instead you can just focus on quickly building great apps.

Just know that Apex supports many of the object-oriented principles that you’re probably used to, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and even polymorphism. In fact, the Apex language includes many language constructs you’re already familiar with, including classes, interfaces, properties, and collections.

But watch out, because these aren’t the same enums you’re used to working with in .NET. In Apex, you can use enums with numbers, but you can’t define what these number values are. Also, the ordinal assignment starts at zero. For example, if you had an enum like the following.

Working with Collections
.NET supports a large collection library with numerous types and extension methods. And here’s some good news. Apex has only the following three collections. Talk about simple, right?

2023-04-04 12:15:12,979 - INFO - Processed paragraph 23 in d1.txt: List
A list is an ordered collection of elements that works much the same as a traditional array. In fact, arrays in Apex are synonymous with lists, and you can use them interchangeably. For example, the following is one way to declare a variable as a list of strings.

2023-04-04 12:15:14,035 - INFO - Processed paragraph 24 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings =  new List<String>();
Alternatively, you can declare the myStrings variable as an array but assign it to a list rather than an array.

2023-04-04 12:15:15,717 - INFO - Processed paragraph 25 in d1.txt: String[] myStrings = new List<String>();
Another thing you can do is declare the list and initialize its values, all in one step, such as the following.
2023-04-04 12:15:15,718 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-04 12:15:17,064 - INFO - Processed paragraph 26 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings =  new List<String> {'String1', 'String2', 'String3' };
You can also add values to the list after it has been created, such as this:
2023-04-04 12:15:17,064 - INFO - No related goals found
2023-04-04 12:15:19,140 - INFO - Processed paragraph 27 in d1.txt: List<String> myStrings = new List<String>();
myStrings.add('String1');
myStrings.add('String2');
myStrings.add('String3');
You’ll probably create a lot of list variables in your Apex development, because the output of every SOQL query is a list. For example, you could create a list of Accounts using code such as the following:
2023-04-04 12:15:19,141 - INFO - Related goals: 6
2023-04-04 12:15:23,508 - INFO - Processed paragraph 28 in d1.txt: List<Account> myAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];
Like arrays, lists have indexes that start at zero. So you could access the name of the first account in the list with code like this:

2023-04-04 12:15:29,819 - INFO - Processed paragraph 29 in d1.txt: List<Account> myAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];
String firstAccount = myAccounts[0].Name;
Set
A set is an unordered collection of elements that does not contain duplicates. A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique. You could then use the set as part of a WHERE clause in a SOQL query. For example, here we’re creating a set that contains two unique IDs for Accounts. We then use the set in the SOQL query to return Accounts only for those IDs.

List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Name
  FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];    
Map
A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key maps to a single value. A map is useful when you need to quickly find something by a key. The key values must be unique, so you could have a map that contained ID values for the key and then mapped to an sObject. For example, you could use the following code to declare a map variable named accountMap that contains all Accounts mapped to their IDs.

You can use either one to render web pages, and both separate the application logic from the markup and the database model, but they do so in different ways.

It’s basically system-generated code that allows you to quickly incorporate basic CRUD functionality in your Visualforce pages. But before you start getting worried, just know that you can create your own custom controllers to add in more complex functioning.

Apex code and the Lightning Platform database are tightly coupled to the point where they are sometimes indistinguishable. Each standard or custom object in the database has a "mystical" representation via an Apex class that provides all sorts of functionality to make interacting with the database a snap. The class and its underlying object are essentially a mirror image of one another that is constantly in sync. For instance, whenever you create a new field in an object, a class member is automatically surfaced to reference the values in the database. It's also impossible to add a reference in your Apex code to a field that doesn't exist; the compiler will return an error and simply not save your code. The platform works hard to ensure these dependencies and won't let the database schema and your code become out of sync. Therefore, if you attempt to delete a custom object or a field that is referenced by Apex code, the platform will raise an error and disallow the action.

That’s what makes the multiple object search beneficial: You get to search through multiple objects at the same time because the type of record doesn’t matter to the user.

Multiple object search—Because you can only retrieve data from multiple objects that are related to one another, the multiple object search in SOQL is limited. In our scenario, the objects were unrelated, so SOSL it is.
Custom object search—As with a single object search, you could search through custom objects in SOQL fine. However, we didn’t specify in which field the data resides for our search term pink hi-top. In addition, SOQL searches against the database, not the index. So, let’s say that the record actually included pink sneaker hi-top. SOQL wouldn’t be able to return the right results.

Now let’s talk search results. Yes, users think they want to see all the results. But if you have thousands of records, it’s time to reconsider that stance. Think about how you could limit the results or at least break them up into smaller, easier-to-digest chunks.

Now that you’re getting the hang of this, let’s try out some WITH statements, which filter records by certain predefined fields. By prefiltering results, you return fewer results and improve performance. Plus, users don’t need to wade through as many results. What types of WITH filters does SOSL offer? Well, here they are:

A search for one term in a synonym group returns results for all terms in the group. For example, a search for USB returns results for all terms in the synonym group, which contains USB, thumb drive, flash stick, and memory stick. You’re probably seeing the value of synonym groups already. Users can search using one term and still get the results they want even if they don’t use the “right” search term. No renaming of products required.

Previously, a team member could accidentally overwrite someone’s changes by deploying a change set right over an existing change set. Now they commit changes to the source repository to identify and merge any customization conflicts before they continue.

This module doesn’t have a hands-on challenge. However, we understand that trailblazers don’t tend to sit on the sidelines. If you try the steps demonstrated in this module, we provide guideposts (notes) when your instructions differ from Ella and Juan’s. Keep your sandboxes for “real” development work. Before you begin, sign up for a Developer Edition org or Trailhead playground to use in place of each sandbox.

Create the .zip file of your changes:For Windows:
jar -cfM winter19.zip tmp_convert
For Unix/Linux:

For Mac:
zip -r -X winter19.zip tmp_convert
Delete the output directory, tmp_convert. You can remove it quickly on the command line, or use Windows Explorer or Finder if you prefer.For Windows:
rmdir /s tmp_convert
For Mac/Unix/Linux:
rm -r tmp_convert
Test the release artifact in the Developer Pro sandbox.
The .zip file is the release artifact. The command also creates a manifest in the output directory (package.xml). The manifest indicates what changes to include in the build artifact.

For ASP.NET applications, code is executed in the context of an application domain. In the Lightning Platform world, code executes within an execution context. In a nutshell, this context represents the time between when the code is executed and when it ends. The important thing for you to understand is that the Apex code you write is not always the only code that is executing.

Similar to triggers in SQL Server, Apex database triggers execute programming logic before or after events to records in Salesforce. When defining the trigger, you can specify more than one of the following events:

It’s considered a best practice to use only one trigger per object, which you see in the following example. You can then use context-specific handler methods within triggers to create logic-less triggers. By adopting this practice, you can avoid the common pitfalls that new developers fall into.

As a .NET developer, you probably have already been exposed to the world of asynchronous programming. We’ll assume that you know what it is and understand the benefits to using this type of programming model. What you might not know is when to use asynchronous programming on the Lightning Platform.

2023-04-04 12:21:43,269 - INFO - Processed paragraph 6 in d3.txt: Processing a very large number of records. This reason is unique to the multi-tenanted world of the Lightning Platform where limits rule. The limits associated with asynchronous processes are higher than those with synchronous processes. Therefore, if you need to process thousands or even millions of records, asynchronous processing is your best bet.
Making callouts to external web services. Callouts can take a long time to process, but in the Lightning Platform, triggers can’t make callouts directly.
Creating a better and faster user experience by offloading some processing to asynchronous calls. Why do everything at once? If it can wait, let it.
Future Methods
In situations where you need to make a callout to a web service or want to offload simple processing to an asynchronous task, creating a future method could be the way to go.

2023-04-04 12:21:47,593 - INFO - Processed paragraph 7 in d3.txt: Changing a method from synchronous to asynchronous processing is amazingly easy. Essentially, you just add the @future annotation to your method. Other than that, just make sure that the method is static and returns only a void type. For example, to create a method for performing a web service callout, we could do something like this:

    @future(callout=true)    
    static void myFutureMethod(Set<Id> ids) {
        // Get the list of contacts in the future method since
        // you cannot pass objects as arguments to future methods
        List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, LastName, FirstName, Email
            FROM Contact WHERE Id IN :ids];
        // Loop through the results and call a method
        // which contains the code to do the actual callout
        for (Contact con: contacts) {
            String response = anotherClass.calloutMethod(con.Id,
                con.FirstName,
                con.LastName,
                con.Email);
            // May want to add some code here to log
            // the response to a custom object
        }
    }
}
We could then call it just like we would any other static method. Easy peasy!

Another long-used asynchronous tool is the batchable interface. The No. 1 reason to use it is if you need to process a large number of records. For example, if you want to clean up or archive up to 50 million records, the batchable interface is your answer. You can even schedule your batches to run at a particular time.

It can import up to 50,000 records at a time. It provides a simple interface to specify the configuration parameters, data sources, and the field mappings that map the field names in your import file with the field names in Salesforce.
Data Loader—this is a client application that can import up to five million records at a time, of any data type, either from files or a database connection. It can be operated either through the user interface or the command line. In the latter case, you need to specify data sources, field mappings, and other parameters via configuration files. This makes it possible to automate the import process, using API calls.
Note
With both methods, the number of records you can import depends on your permissions, the type of data you’re importing, and the overall data storage limits for your organization. The type of objects you can import depends on your edition.

Data Loader uses the SOAP API to process records. For faster processing, you can configure it to use the Bulk API instead. The Bulk API is optimized to load a large number of records simultaneously. It is faster than the SOAP API due to parallel processing and fewer network round-trips.

Cloud Kicks manufactures custom sneakers, designed and personalized for their customers. Sales superstars Candace and Jose are always eager to get fresh air and exercise, so they schedule a walking meeting with Linda, the company’s Salesforce admin. They want Linda’s help to bring their CRM data into Salesforce. Because they have fewer than 50,000 records, Linda decides to use the Data Import Wizard. When she gets back to her desk after the walk, she preps the data for import.

Use your existing software to create an export file. You'll use this exported data file to now import the data into Salesforce.
Clean up the import file for accuracy and consistency. This involves updating the data to remove duplicates, delete unnecessary information, correct spelling and other errors, and enforce naming conventions.
Compare your data fields with the Salesforce fields you can import into, and verify that your data will be mapped into the appropriate Salesforce fields. You might need to fine-tune the mapping before starting the import. For details, see Field Mapping for Data Sources in the online help.
Make any configuration changes required in Salesforce to handle the imported data. For example, you might need to create new custom fields, add new values to picklists, or temporarily deactivate workflow rules.
Note
Salesforce recommends you import using a small test file first to make sure you’ve prepared your source data correctly.

Once you have created an export file and cleaned up the data for import, follow these steps to import data using the Data Import Wizard.
Start the wizard.
From Setup, enter Data Import Wizard in the Quick Find box, then select Data Import Wizard. 
Review the information provided on the welcome page, then click Launch Wizard!
Choose the data that you want to import.
To import accounts, contacts, leads, solutions, person accounts, or campaign members, click Standard Objects. To import custom objects, click Custom Objects.
Specify whether you want to add new records to Salesforce, update existing records, or add and update records simultaneously.
Specify matching and other criteria as necessary. Hover over the question marks for more information about each option.
Specify the file that contains your data. You can specify your data file by dragging the CSV to the upload area of the page or by clicking the CSV category you’re using and then navigating to and selecting the file.
Choose a character encoding method for your file. Most users can accept the default character encoding.
Click Next. 
Map your data fields to Salesforce data fields. The Data Import Wizard tries to map as many of your data fields as possible to standard Salesforce data fields. If Salesforce can’t automatically map fields, however, you do it manually. Unmapped fields are not imported into Salesforce. To see a list of standard Salesforce data fields, from Setup, at the top of the page, click Object Manager. Click the object whose fields you’re interested in, and click Fields & Relationships. For example, if you want to see a list of standard Salesforce fields for leads, click Object Manager | Lead | Fields & Relationships.
Scan the list of mapped data fields and locate any unmapped fields.
Click Map to the left of each unmapped field.
In the Map Your Field dialog box, choose the Salesforce fields you want to map to and click Map. The Map Your Field dialog box also gives you the option of saving data from unmapped fields in a general notes field for accounts and contacts. To do so, choose Account Note or Contact Note from the Map To drop-down list and click Map.
To change mappings that Salesforce performed automatically, click Change to the left of the appropriate field, then choose the Salesforce fields you want to map to and click Map.
Click Next.
Review and start your import.
Review your import information on the Review page. If you still have unmapped fields that you want to import, click Previous to return to the previous page and specify your mappings.
Click Start Import.
Check import status. From Setup, enter “Bulk Data Load Jobs” in the Quick Find box, then select Bulk Data Load Jobs.  The user who starts the data import receives a status email when the import is completed.
Note
Use the zoom option in your browser to adjust (shrink) the size of the content if you can't see the Map button.

This information can help you integrate your imported data into Salesforce.
New Values for Picklists and Multi-Select Picklists—If you import a picklist value that doesn’t match an existing picklist value:
For an unrestricted picklist, the Data Import Wizard uses the value that’s in the import file.
For a restricted picklist, the Data Import Wizard uses the picklist’s default value.
Multi-Select Picklists—To import multiple values into a multi-select picklist, separate the values by a semicolon in your import file.
Checkboxes—To import data into a checkbox field, use 1 for checked values and 0 for unchecked values.
Default Values—For picklist, multi-select picklist, and checkbox fields, if you do not map the field in the import wizard, the default value for the field, if any, is automatically inserted into the new or updated record.
Date/Time Fields—Ensure that the format of any date/time fields you are importing matches how they display in Salesforce per your locale setting.
Formula Fields—Formula fields cannot accept imported data because they are read-only.
Field Validation Rules—Salesforce runs validation rules on records before they are imported. Records that fail validation aren’t imported. Consider deactivating the appropriate validation rules before running an import if they affect the records you are importing.

Describe and compare the two methods of exporting data from Salesforce.
Export data manually using the Data Export Service.
Set up automatic export of data on a weekly or monthly schedule.
Introduction to Data Export
You can easily export data from Salesforce, either manually or on an automatic schedule. The data is exported as a set of comma-separated values (CSV) files. Data export tools provide a convenient way to obtain a copy of your Salesforce data, either for backup or for importing into a different system.

2023-04-04 12:23:25,959 - INFO - Processed paragraph 3 in d6.txt: Data Export Service—an in-browser service, accessible through the Setup menu. It allows you to export data manually once every 7 days (for weekly export) or 29 days (for monthly export). You can also export data automatically at weekly or monthly intervals. Weekly exports are available in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions. In Professional Edition and Developer Edition, you can generate backup files only every 29 days, or automatically at monthly intervals only.
Data Loader—a client application that you must install separately. It can be operated either through the user interface or the command line. The latter option is useful if you want to automate the export process, or use APIs to integrate with another system.
Using the Data Export Service
Get Cloudy is a high-tech consulting firm specializing in CRM implementations. Charnice Jones-Bauer, Get Cloudy’s financial analyst, knows that data loss can have a serious financial impact on the business, so she sets up a meeting in the employee cafe with Salesforce admin Chinua Toure to talk about backups. Chinua explains that he automates weekly backups with the Data Export Service.

The Export Now option prepares your files for export immediately. This option is only available if enough time has passed since your last export.
The Schedule Export option allows you to schedule the export process for weekly or monthly intervals.
Select the desired encoding for your export file.
If you want images, documents, attachments, and so on included in your data, select the appropriate options.
Select Replace carriage returns with spaces to have spaces instead of carriage returns or line breaks in your export files. This is useful if you plan to use your export files for importing or other integrations.
If you're scheduling your export, select the frequency (only available for organizations with monthly exports), start and end dates, and time of day for your scheduled export.
Under Exported Data, select the types of data to include in your export. We recommend that you select Include all data if you’re not familiar with the terminology used for some of the types of data.
Click Start Export or Save. Salesforce creates a zip archive of CSV files and emails you when it's ready. Exports will complete as soon as possible, however we can't guarantee the date and time the export will complete. Large exports are broken up into multiple files. Follow the link in the email or click Data Export to download the zip file. Zip files are deleted 48 hours after the email is sent.

Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL)
Both SOQL and SOSL format text queries in a given API. But that’s where the similarities end. A SOQL query is the equivalent of a SELECT SQL statement and searches the org database. On the other hand, SOSL is a programmatic way of performing a text-based search against the search index. SOSL uses all the great, previously mentioned features of the search index.

2023-04-04 12:24:48,750 - INFO - Processed paragraph 19 in d9.txt: Retrieve data for a specific term that you know exists within a field. Because SOSL can tokenize multiple terms within a field and build a search index from this, SOSL searches are faster and can return more relevant results.
Retrieve multiple objects and fields efficiently, and the objects might or might not be related to one another.
Retrieve data for a particular division in an organization using the divisions feature, and you want to find it in the most efficient way possible.
Now let’s look at two additional API types.

2023-04-04 12:24:49,756 - INFO - Processed paragraph 20 in d9.txt: First up, suggested records API. Perhaps you already know suggested records by its aliases: auto-suggestion, instant results, or type-ahead. You’re probably familiar with the behavior, too. Let’s say you’re using a website that sells the coolest running shoes available. It uses a customized Salesforce search solution for its knowledge base to encourage a community of runners. You want to know which shoes to buy for trail running. You start typing “trail running” in the search bar, and it presents options for articles that include the search terms in the title.

2023-04-04 12:24:53,905 - INFO - Processed paragraph 23 in d9.txt: We’ve been talking a lot about how to find records inside Salesforce. But what if you have records stored outside of Salesforce that users access for their jobs? Well, we’ve got a solution for that too: Salesforce Federated Search. It’s the new way for users to search for items stored outside of Salesforce—all while remaining inside Salesforce Classic, Salesforce Console, or Lightning Experience.

2023-04-04 12:24:54,910 - INFO - Processed paragraph 24 in d9.txt: Salesforce Federated Search allows you to make the global search box an external search engine. When Federated Search is set up, we transfer the user’s query to the external engine, which searches the external sources. The results are returned right in the Salesforce search results. We do this through the Salesforce Federated Search connector. The connector is built using the OpenSearch specification, so you can plug in any search engine that conforms to this industry standard.

Instead, results are returned according to the external search provider, which is cool too.

You can write all the beautiful search queries that you want. But they aren’t any good unless you use an API protocol like REST, SOAP, or Apex to actually send them.

2023-04-04 12:25:01,642 - INFO - Processed paragraph 28 in d9.txt: Keep in mind that some protocols get along better with some APIs than others. In general, we talk about queries with SOQL and searches with SOSL.

2023-04-04 12:25:03,254 - INFO - Processed paragraph 29 in d9.txt: Query (REST) and query() (SOAP)—Executes a SOQL query against the specified object and returns data that matches the specified criteria.
Search (REST) and search() (SOAP)—Executes a SOSL text string search against your org’s data.
More resources to perform other common search tasks, like auto-suggesting records, articles, and queries, are also available. And, if you’d rather not use SOSL or SOQL, consider Parameterized Search in REST. Instead of a search string in the URL, you use parameters (hence the name) in the URL.

You can also use a Search Class to perform dynamic SOSL queries and a Search Namespace for getting search results and suggestion results.
