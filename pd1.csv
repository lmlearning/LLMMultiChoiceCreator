Choose one answer
A. Reducing the number of API requests made to the server
B. Increasing the performance of the application
C. Allowing class methods to be called by triggers and other classes
D. Providing a more secure way to store sensitive data

Answers: C
Explanation: One of the benefits of Apex classes is code reuse. Class methods can be called by triggers and other classes, enabling developers to reduce redundancy and write more efficient code."
2,"What is the minimum code coverage required to deploy code or package it to the Lightning Platform AppExchange?
Choose one answer
A. 50%
B. 75%
C. 90%
D. 100%

Answers: B
Explanation: According to Salesforce, before you can deploy your code or package it for the Lightning Platform AppExchange, at least 75% of Apex code must be covered by tests, and all those tests must pass. In addition, each trigger must have some coverage. It is important to note that while code coverage is a requirement for deployment, it should not be the sole reason for writing tests. Tests should also cover common use cases, including positive and negative test cases, and bulk and single-record processing, among others."
3,"Which of the following is NOT a reason to aim for high code coverage when writing tests?
Choose one answer.
A. Ensuring that all data values for conditional code execution are covered
B. Increasing the likelihood that your code is robust
C. Meeting the minimum code coverage requirement for deployments and packages
D. Catching failures and errors in your code

Answers: C
Explanation: While meeting the minimum code coverage requirement is important, it is not the only reason to aim for high code coverage. High code coverage increases the likelihood that your code is robust and catches failures and errors. Another reason to aim for high code coverage is to ensure that all data values for conditional code execution are covered."
4,"Which statement is true regarding creating test data in Apex?
Choose one answer 
A. Salesforce records created in test methods are permanently stored in the database.
B. Pre-existing data in the org is only available to Apex tests when annotated with (SeeAllData=true).
C. The creation of test data in Apex is optional and not necessary for testing.
D. Test data rolls back when the test finishes executing.

Answer: D
Explanation: In Apex, records created in test methods aren't committed to the database, but are rolled back after the test has finished executing. This prevents unneeded test data from being stored in the database and cleans up after the test. Pre-existing data in the org is only available to test classes when annotated with (SeeAllData=true), but it is not a best practice to access org data in tests. Creating test data is optional, but it is strongly recommended, as it makes tests more robust and prevents failures caused by missing or changed data in the org."
5,"Which statement is true about calling a class method that executes asynchronously in Apex?
Choose one answer
A. The method can only be called in a trigger
B. The method can only be called from ApexBatch class
C. The method must be annotated with @future(callout=true)
D. The method must not contain any DML statements

Answers: C
Explanation: To make a callout from a trigger, call a class method that executes asynchronously. Such a method is called a future method and is annotated with @future(callout=true). Option A is incorrect as asynchronous methods can also be called outside of a trigger. Option B is incorrect as there is no requirement for async methods to only be used with ApexBatch. Option D is incorrect as there is no restriction on using DML statements in asynchronous methods."
6,"Explain the benefits of using Lightning Web Components and how to get started developing them.

Answers: A, B
Explanation: The two use cases that require a partial copy or full sandbox are Development Testing and Quality Assurance Testing. Development Testing uses the sandbox environment to build, develop, and test new functionality before deploying to production. Quality Assurance Testing uses the sandbox environment to test the functionality of new changes, code or metadata, in a real-life but separate environment from production.

Where is client-side controller logic contained in the Lightning Component framework?

Choose one answer:
A. Apex
B. Visualforce 
C. HTML

Explanation: Client-side controller logic in the Lightning Component framework is contained within JavaScript. Specifically, these are JavaScript controllers that are used to handle client-side events and interact with the server-side or client-side actions.

A developer creates a method in an Apex class and needs to ensure that errors are handled properly. Which three should the developer use?

Choose three answers:
A. ApexPages.addErrorMessage()
B. A custom exception
C. .addError()
D. Database.handleException()
E. A try/catch construct

Answers: B, C, E
Explanation: To ensure that errors are handled properly when creating a method in an Apex class, the developer should use a custom exception, the .addError() method, and a try/catch construct. Custom exceptions allow developers to handle specific errors in a more fine-tuned way. The .addError() method is used to add an error message to a record, which can be displayed to the user. And a try/catch construct is used to handle any potential exceptions that may occur within the method. Database.handleException() is not necessary in this scenario as it handles exceptions thrown by the database, not exceptions in Apex code."
7,"Developers who use Apex must consider several factors in order to maintain security and ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed. Which three of the following are true regarding the use of Apex in system context? Choose three answers.
A. Apex code can access all objects and fields, regardless of user permissions, field-level security, or organization-wide defaults.
B. Most of the time, system context provides the correct behavior for system-level operations such as triggers and web services that need access to all data in an organization.
C. Sharing rules are always enforced for Apex code that runs in system context.
D. The without sharing keyword can be used to ensure that sharing rules are not enforced for a specific Apex class.
E. The executeAnonymous call and Chatter in Apex are the only exceptions to the way Apex runs in system context.
F. The with sharing keyword can be used to specify that sharing rules for the current user are considered for a specific Apex class.

Answers: A, B, D
Explanation: Apex code generally runs in system context, which means that it has access to all objects and fields without regard to user permissions, field-level security, or organization-wide defaults. Most of the time, system context provides the correct behavior for system-level operations such as triggers and web services that need access to all data in an organization. However, sharing rules are not always bypassed in system context. Developers can use the without sharing keyword to ensure that sharing rules are not enforced for a specific Apex class. The executeAnonymous call and Chatter in Apex are the only exceptions to the way Apex runs in system context. The with sharing keyword can be used to specify that sharing rules for the current user are considered for a specific Apex class."
8,"Before inserting an opportunity record into the database, what should a developer do to ensure the logged-in user has the appropriate permissions?
Choose one answer
A. Check with the Security and SObjectAccessDecision classes to verify CRUD permissions.
B. Check the code to see if the user has create permissions on isCreateable() permissions on Opportunity.Amount.
C. Use the stripInaccessible method, which can be used to remove inaccessible sObject fields before DML operations to avoid exceptions.
D. All of the above.

Answers: B
Explanation: To ensure that the user calling the function has authorization to create opportunities and opportunity amounts, your Apex code should perform a check to see if the user has the create permission on isCreateable() permission on Opportunity.Amount. Only option B covers this requirement, making it the correct answer. Option A refers to a different way of checking permissions, and option C talks about something unrelated to the question."
9,"Write a new exam question:

Which of the following is a trigger created to prevent deletion of accounts when related opportunities exist and it only fires before the record is deleted?

A. AccountDeletionTrigger
B. OpportunityDeletionTrigger
C. AccountOpportunityTrigger
D. DeleteRelatedRecordTrigger

Answers: A
Explanation: In the given scenario, the trigger created to prevent deletion of accounts when related opportunities exist is the AccountDeletion trigger. This trigger fires only before the record is deleted. Therefore, option A is correct while the other options are incorrect. Option B, OpportunityDeletionTrigger, is invalid because it is not specified that it needs to fire when related opportunities exist; option C, AccountOpportunityTrigger, is not a trigger name that exists in the given scenario; and option D, DeleteRelatedRecordTrigger, is invalid because it is not clarified which record is being deleted."
10,"Which of the following is a benefit of using bulk design patterns in Apex triggers?
Choose one answer
A. Better performance
B. Increased server resources usage
C. Decreased governor limits
D. Risk of hitting query limits

Answers: A
Explanation: Apex triggers are optimized to operate in bulk and are designed to consume as few server resources as possible while staying within governor limits. Using bulk design patterns in Apex triggers also results in better performance as compared to individual record processing."
11,"For what use cases can @future methods be used?
Choose three answers
A. Performing synchronous processes.
B. Callouts to external web services.
C. Isolating DML operations on different sObject types.
D. Executing processes in a separate thread.
E. Manipulating standard or custom objects.

Answers: B, C, D
Explanation: Future Apex methods are used to run processes in a separate thread at a later time when system resources become available. Future methods are also typically used for callouts to external web services, isolating DML operations on different sObject types to prevent mixed DML errors, and executing operations you want to run in their own thread when time permits, such as resource-intensive calculation or processing of records. Future methods cannot be used for performing synchronous processes or manipulating standard or custom objects."
12,"Which of the following statements are true regarding the use of future methods in Apex?
Choose two answers
A. Methods with the @future annotation can return any primitive data type.
B. The parameters of a future method can accept objects as arguments.
C. Future methods can be guaranteed to execute in the same order they are called.
D. Future methods can be called from Visualforce controllers.
E. You can call a future method from within another future method.

Answers: B, E
Explanation: When using future methods in Apex, it's important to keep in mind the limitations and restrictions that come with them. Methods with the @future annotation must be static methods and can only return a void type. Additionally, the parameters of a future method can only accept primitive data types, arrays of primitive data types, or collections of primitive data types. Future methods are also not guaranteed to execute in the order they are called, and two future methods could run concurrently, which could cause issues with record locking if they were to update the same record. Future methods cannot be called from Visualforce controllers, and as a best practice, you should not call a future method from within another future method to prevent recursive future method calls."
13,"Create a new exam question based on the provided format and content:

In a Lightning web component, which decorator must be used to mark a field as publicly available to component consumers as object properties?
Choose one answer
A. @api
B. @track 
C. @wire
D. None of the above

Answers: A
Explanation: The @api decorator marks a field as public. Public properties define the API for a component. An owner component that uses the component in its HTML markup can access the component's public properties. In a Lightning web component, only fields that a component author decorates with @api are publicly available to consumers as object properties."

16,"A developer wants to create a batch Apex job to update contact records with their associated accounts' billing address as their mailing address for all companies in the USA. Which two methods must the developer implement in the Batch Apex class?
Choose two answers.
A. start
B. execute
C. finish
D. update

Answers: A, B
Explanation: In order to create a Batch Apex job, the class must implement the Database.Batchable interface and include the start, execute, and finish methods. The start method is used to collect the records or objects to be passed to the execute method for processing. The execute method performs the actual processing for each chunk or ""batch"" of data passed to the method. Therefore, options A and B are correct. The finish method is used to execute post-processing operations and is called once after all batches are processed. Option C is also correct. Option D is not correct as update is a DML statement and not a method in the Database.Batchable interface."
17,"Which two testing use cases require a partial copy or full sandbox in Salesforce?
Choose two answers
A. Scalability Testing
B. Development Testing
C. Quality Assurance Testing 
D. Batch Data Testing

Answers: C, D
Explanation: Quality Assurance Testing and Batch Data Testing are two use cases that require a partial copy or full sandbox. Quality Assurance testing requires a sandbox with similar data volumes to the production environment to ensure accurate testing. Batch data testing requires new data for testing purposes, which can't be done in a production environment. Scalability testing and development testing do not explicitly require a partial copy or full sandbox.

B. A custom exception
C. .addError()
D. Database.handleException()
E. A try/catch construct

Answers: B, C, E
Explanation: A developer creating a method in an Apex class and needing to ensure errors are handled properly should consider using a custom exception, the .addError() method to add custom errors to fields or records, and/or a try/catch construct to catch and handle exceptions. ApexPages.addErrorMessage() is used to add an error message to a Visualforce page and Database.handleException() is used to obtain details about a caught exception but is not specifically used to handle the exception itself."
18,"In a Salesforce debug log, what does the event column represent?
Choose one answer
A. The time when the event occurred
B. The event that triggered the debug log entry 
C. Details about the line of code and the method name where the code was executed
D. The nanoseconds (in parentheses) since the start of the event in a raw log

Answers: B
Explanation: The event column in a debug log represents the event that triggered the debug log entry. The timestamp column represents the time when the event occurred, while the details column provides information about the line of code and the method name where the code was executed. The timestamp in a raw log shows the time elapsed in nanoseconds (in parentheses) since the start of the event. 

What is the recommended naming convention for Lightning web components?
Choose one answer
A. UpperCamelCase
B. kebab-case
C. snake_case
D. camelCase

Answers: D
Explanation: Lightning web components follow web standards and the HTML standard recommends that multi-word custom element names contain a hyphen. However, the Salesforce platform doesn't allow hyphens in the component folder or file names. So, the Salesforce platform uses camelCase naming conventions for Lightning web components.

B. A process builder with multiple actions executed when data is entered
C. A formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “True” or “False”
D. Custom fields that automatically populate based on the data entered

Answers: C
Explanation: Validation rules can include a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “True” or “False.” These rules are used to verify that data entered by users in records meets the standards you specify before they can save it. Workflow rules and process builders are tools used to automate processes that occur after data has been entered, while custom fields are used to capture data entered by users."
20,"In the code sample shown for testing queueable Apex, what should the test method do after submitting the queueable job to the queue?
Choose one answer
A. Stop the asynchronous process through Apex code
B. Query the account records that the job updated
C. Validate that the test data is properly associated with the queueable class object
D. Verify that the processing logic in the execute() method of the queueable class is correct

Answers: B
Explanation: After submitting the queueable job to the queue between the Test.startTest and Test.stopTest blocks, the test method should query the account records that the job updated. This is done to validate the results of the queueable job in the test method. The system executes all asynchronous processes started in a test method synchronously after the Test.stopTest statement. The correct answer is B."
21,"In the Lightning Component framework, what technique can be used to pass information from a child component to a parent component?
Choose one answer
A. Method invocation
B. Direct attribute setting
C. Event dispatch and listening
D. Parent access to child attributes

Answers: C
Explanation: To pass information from a child component to a parent component in the Lightning Component framework, event dispatch and listening can be used. The child component dispatches an event including an object that holds the information the parent component wants to access. The parent component listens for these events and has an event handler function. The event handler receives the object as a parameter and manipulates the necessary parent attributes."
22,"Which two are valid ways to pass information down from parent to child components in Lightning Web Components?
Choose two answers.
A. Using a custom exception
B. Using public properties with the @api decorator
C. Using the querySelector() DOM method
D. Using getters and setters

Answers: B, D
Explanation: In LWC, a parent component can pass information down to a child component using public properties decorated with @api. Additionally, you can use getters and setters to execute some logic when properties are get or set. Using a custom exception has nothing to do with passing information between components in LWC. Similarly, querySelector() method is used to search for a specific DOM element, but not for passing information between components."
23,"In unit testing Scheduled Apex, what method should be used to ensure that the scheduled job is finished before testing against the results?
Choose one answer
A. System.schedule()
B. Query Editor
C. startTest() and stopTest()
D. SOSL search

Choose one answer:
A. It uses built-in messaging methods of the Apex class library.
B. It has a private helper method that cannot be called externally.
C. It can be called by triggers and other classes.
D. It stores a string of hardcoded text for the email message.

Answer: A
Explanation: In the provided content, the EmailManager class's method (sendMail()) sends email and uses built-in messaging methods of the Apex class library. This method can be called externally by anonymous Apex execution, and by triggers and other classes. Additionally, this class has a private helper method (inspectResults()), which is used only within the class to inspect the result of the email send call. Choice D is incorrect because the text for the email body is generated dynamically and passed in as a parameter to the sendMail() method."
29,"Which statement about creating test data in Apex tests is true?
Choose one answer
A. Test methods can access pre-existing data by default.
B. Test data created in test methods is committed to the database.
C. Creating test data is not necessary for robust tests.
D. Test classes annotated with @isTest don't count towards the Apex code limit.

Answer: C
Explanation: The content provided states that Apex records created in test methods are rolled back when the test finishes execution, which means that they're not committed to the database. It also states that creating test data makes tests more robust and prevents failures caused by missing or changed data. However, it also states that by default, Apex tests don't have access to pre-existing data in the org, except for access to setup and metadata objects, such as the User or Profile objects. Finally, it notes that test classes annotated with @isTest don't count towards the Apex code limit."

Choose one answer
A. Opportunity Type
B. Opportunity Date
C. Big Opportunity
D. Opportunity Owner

Answers: C
Explanation: To determine whether an opportunity is a ""big"" opportunity, the formula checks whether the number of employees at the opportunity account’s associated company is greater than 1,000 AND whether the opportunity amount is greater than $10,000. If both statements are true, the field ""Big Opportunity"" appears as a checked box on the Opportunity page layout. Otherwise, it appears as a blank box. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
36,"When creating a new contact, how can a developer check the field-level create permission of the contact's email field?
Choose one answer
A. if (Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Email.isUpdateable())
B. if (Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Email.isReadable())
C. if (Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fields.Email.isCreateable())
D. if (Schema.sObjectType.Contact.fieldsets.Email.isCreateable())

Answers: C
Explanation: The code snippet uses the isCreateable() method to check the field-level create permission of the Contact's email field. The isUpdateable() method checks whether the field can be updated, and the isReadable() method checks whether the field can be read. There is no fieldset called ""Email,"" so option D is incorrect."

Explanation: When addError() is called in a trigger, the entire set of operations rolls back, except when bulk DML is called with partial success. This means that any error in any record of the operation will result in a rollback. However, if partial success occurs during the bulk DML operation, the runtime engine sets the bad records aside and attempts a partial save of the records that did not generate errors."

83,"Which option allows a developer to fine tune automation timing within a record-triggered flow?
Choose one answer.
A. A transaction
B. An Apex class
C. A trigger
D. Visualforce page

Answer: A transaction.

Explanation: In a record-triggered flow, the change to the record has already started to be processed by the initial triggering transaction. To improve performance and avoid conflicts, developers can fine-tune automation timing using options such as adding a wait element or using a sub-flow. This allows other processes, such as validation rules, to complete before the automation begins, reducing the risk of unnecessary workflow evaluations or other automation processes."
84,"In which scenario should you use the ""Run Asynchronously"" option in a flow?
Choose one answer
A. When updating the record that triggered the flow
B. When automating common processes triggered by record changes
C. When sending requests to external systems or performing longer running processes
D. When scheduling reminders or follow-ups based on dates in the record 

Answers: C

85,"What does the stripInaccessible method do in Salesforce and when should it be used?
Choose one answer
A. It removes fields and relationship fields from query and subquery results that the user can access and should be used before performing a CRUD check on an object.
B. It removes inaccessible sObject fields before DML operations, sanitizes sObjects that have been deserialized from an untrusted source, and should be used to enforce field- and object-level data protection.
C. It creates a return list of sObjects that is identical to the source records, except that the fields that are accessible to the current user are removed, and should be used to check the user's CRUD access to an object.
D. It checks the field-level permissions of the user and removes the fields that the user can't access, used in Visualforce pages to display only available fields.

Answer: B
Explanation: The stripInaccessible method is used to enforce field- and object-level data protection in Salesforce. It can be used to remove inaccessible sObject fields before DML operations to avoid exceptions and to sanitize sObjects that have been deserialized from an untrusted source. The method can also be used to strip the fields and relationship fields from query and subquery results that the user can't access, ensuring data protection. Therefore, the correct answer is B."

89,"Which two object relationships are available in Salesforce?
Choose two answers
A. Parent-Child Relationships
B. Lookup Relationships
C. Master-Detail Relationships
D. Peer Relationships

Answers: B, C
Explanation: Salesforce offers two main types of object relationships: lookup and master-detail. Lookup relationships essentially link two objects together so that you can “look up” one object from the related items on another object. Master-detail relationships are a bit tighter. In this type of relationship, one object is the master and another is the detail. The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, like who can view the detail’s data. A, D are not valid as there is no such relationship type as Parent-Child or Peer relationships in Salesforce."
90,"Which feature should a developer use to create a draft contract based on a change in the opportunity?
Choose one answer
A. Fast Field Updates
B. Record-triggered process 
C. Actions and Related Records 
D. Flow

Answer: D
Explanation: To create a draft contract based on a change in the opportunity, a flow should be used. Flows can be triggered when a record is created or updated and can perform multiple actions, such as creating a new record or updating an existing one. In this scenario, the flow can parse the opportunity data and create a draft contract record with pre-filled fields. Fast Field Updates allow for quick updates to specific fields on a record without requiring additional validation or processes to run. Record-triggered processes are used to automate processes when a record is created or updated. Actions and Related Records provide a way to take action on related records without leaving the record detail page."
91,"What is needed to build a record-triggered flow that automatically creates contracts for Closed Won high-value opportunities?
Choose three answers
A. Trigger 
B. Criteria 
C. Action
D. Workflow rule

Answers: A, B, C
Explanation: To build a record-triggered flow for automatically creating contracts for Closed Won high-value opportunities, we need to define the business requirement in three parts: trigger, criteria, and action. The trigger is when an opportunity is created or updated, the criteria is that it is high-value and closed won, and the action is to create a draft contract. A workflow rule is not needed in this scenario as we are using a record-triggered flow."
92,"For the Salesforce Flow configuration described above, what object is being used to create a new record?
Choose one answer
A. Contact

What is the purpose of running the flow in the given scenario and how should the flow be executed to meet the requirement mentioned in the content?
Choose two answers
A. To create a new opportunity for organizations that have Closed Won Opportunities with an amount over $25,000
B. To create a draft contract for organizations that have Closed Won Opportunities with an amount over $25,000
C. To update the opportunity amount to be over $25,000 for organizations that have Closed Won Opportunities with an amount under $25,000
D. To update the opportunity amount to be under $25,000 for organizations that have Closed Won Opportunities with an amount over $25,000
E. Select an organization with a Closed Won Opportunity of any amount

Answers: B, E
Explanation: The purpose of running the flow in the scenario is to create a draft contract for organizations that have Closed Won Opportunities with an amount over $25,000. The flow should be executed by selecting an organization with a Closed Won Opportunity of any amount and running the flow with the ""Run the Flow As If the Record Is"" option set to ""Updated"".

94,"What Database method can be used to insert new records with the partial success option and process the results in Apex?
Choose one answer
A. update()
B. upsert()
C. insert()
D. Database.insert()

Answers: D
Explanation: To insert new records with the partial success option and process the results in Apex, we can use Database.insert() method. This method returns a Database.SaveResult object that contains the results of the DML operation, including the success status and any error messages. The other options listed do not support partial success handling."
95,"Which operations require a separate DML call to update related records?
Choose one answer
A. Inserting a record with a lookup relationship to another object
B. Updating a record's phone number that has a related account with a separate Industry field
C. Deleting a parent object with cascading deletions
D. None of the above

Answer: B
Explanation: Fields on related records cannot be updated with the same call to the DML operation and require a separate DML call. This means that updating a record's phone number that has a related account with a separate Industry field requires two separate DML calls - one to update the contact's phone number and another to update the related account's Industry field. Inserting a record with a lookup relationship to another object and deleting a parent object with cascading deletions do not require separate DML calls to update related records."

B. To standardize data before it is inputted by the user
C. To check data for duplicates 
D. To modify data based on user input

Answer: B
Explanation: A validation rule in Salesforce is used to standardize data before it is saved, ensuring that the data entered by a user meets certain standards set by the organization. By verifying data before it is saved, organizations can ensure data quality and consistency, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency. Validation rules can be used to enforce rules such as field formats, data restrictions or to ensure that certain values are entered by users."
99,"Which two Salesforce features are required to trigger a flow on a schedule?
Choose two answers
A. Workflow Rule
B. Process Builder
C. Flow Builder
D. Apex Trigger

Answers: B, C
Explanation: In order to trigger a flow on a schedule, you need to first create a scheduled path. This can be achieved by using Process Builder. Once you create a scheduled path, you can run a record-triggered flow at a specified time using Flow Builder. Therefore, both Process Builder and Flow Builder are required to trigger a flow on a schedule. 

Note: Apex triggers cannot be used to trigger a flow on a schedule. They allow you to execute custom business logic before or after records are inserted, updated, deleted, or restored. They are not designed for scheduling purposes. 

(Alternatively, the answers could be C and D - Flow Builder and Database.handleException() - but this interpretation is less likely given the context.)"
100,"Which Salesforce feature is required to create a 5-day delay in an opportunity flow to remind the opportunity owner to follow up with the account owner after the opportunity closes?
Choose one answer
A. Workflow Rule
B. Scheduled Path
C. Approval Process
D. Validation Rule

Answers: B
Explanation: To create a 5-day delay in an opportunity flow for a reminder task, the scheduled path feature in Lightning Flow or Process Builder must be used. A scheduled path provides the ability to delay a task for a specific number of hours or days. Workflow rules, approval processes and validation rules are not used to create delays in Lightning flows."
101,"In which scenario should a partial copy or full sandbox be used?
Choose one answer
A. When conducting scalability testing
B. When developing new features on a production-like environment 
C. When conducting quality assurance testing only 
D. When conducting batch data testing 

Answers: B
Explanation: Sandbox environments are used for a variety of purposes, including developing new features in a production-like environment, testing those features before deploying them to the production environment, and training users. A partial copy or full sandbox is useful in the development and testing phase because it contains a copy of the production environment's data, metadata, and configuration, ensuring that the new features work as intended in the same conditions in which they will be deployed. Scalability, quality assurance, and batch data testing can also benefit from a testing environment but not necessarily a partial copy or full sandbox.

A. Improved server-side performance
B. Reusability of components
C. Easy maintenance of components
D. Shortened development time
E. Access to more programming languages

Answers: B, C, D
Explanation: By using Lightning web components, developers can reuse their code in different parts of the application or in different applications altogether, making it easier to maintain their components over time. Additionally, because Lightning web components use an intuitive programming model, developers can create components more quickly than they might be able to otherwise. While Lightning web components can be implemented using a server-side programming language, this approach alone is not sufficient to achieve improved performance. However, Lightning web components do enable developers to use different languages on the client side, which can help them to create more robust and scalable applications.

What is required to get started developing Lightning web components?
Choose two answers.
A. A Salesforce developer account
B. A knowledge of Lightning Component framework
C. A local development environment

Explanation: In order to develop Lightning web components, a Salesforce developer account and a local development environment are typically required. Salesforce provides users with the ability to set up a free developer account in order to build and test applications. Additionally, a local development environment is necessary for writing code and testing changes to Lightning web components before deploying them to the Salesforce platform. While a knowledge of the Lightning Component framework can be helpful, it is not strictly necessary to get started with Lightning web components. Finally, while experience working with a Javascript framework may be useful, it is not required. 

Describe the Lightning Web Components programming model.
Answer: Lightning Web Components are based on a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture that separates the code for the user interface (view), the server-side business logic (controller), and the data storage (model). Each Lightning web component consists of a component bundle, which contains the component's code, metadata, and other required resources. Lightning web components use industry-standard web programming technologies—including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to create rich, interactive applications that can run in a variety of web browsers and on mobile devices. By using Lightning web components, developers can easily create reusable, modular components that can be used to build complex applications with minimal code.

146,"Define a CSRF vulnerability: 
A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform unwanted actions on a targeted web application by tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker can forge the user's session credentials and submit requests that seem legitimate to the application.

Identify a CSRF vulnerability in Lightning Platform applications:
A common CSRF vulnerability in Lightning Platform applications is the use of nonces, which are used to validate that a request came from a legitimate source. If nonces are not used or are not properly validated, attackers can use CSRF attacks to forge requests and perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying or deleting data.

Prevent a CSRF vulnerability using code- and org-level protections:
To prevent CSRF vulnerabilities, developers can implement code-level protections such as validating nonces, requiring the use of HTTP POST requests for sensitive operations, and using the @ReadOnly annotation to prevent updates to sensitive data. At the org-level, administrators can enable clickjack protection to prevent the embedding of Salesforce pages in iframes on external sites, and can enforce the use of HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the user's browser and the application. Additionally, users should be educated to avoid clicking on suspicious links or visiting untrusted websites.

C. Call the appropriate access control method of Schema.DescribeFieldResult to verify the current user's access levels for a field
D. Use a try/catch construct to catch any errors related to object-level and field-level permissions

Answers: B, C
Explanation: You can enforce object-level and field-level permissions in your Apex code by explicitly calling the sObject describe result methods (of Schema.DescribeSObjectResult) and the field describe result methods (of Schema.DescribeFieldResult) that check the current user's access permission levels. This allows you to verify if the current user has the necessary permission to perform a specific DML operation or query. For example, you can call the isAccessible, isCreateable, or isUpdateable methods of Schema.DescribeSObjectResult to verify whether the current user has read, create, or update access to an sObject, respectively. Similarly, Schema.DescribeFieldResult exposes these access control methods that you can call to check the current user's read, create, or update access for a field."

B. isDeletable()
C. isAccessible()
D. isCreatable()

Answer: C
Explanation: The isAccessible() method is used to verify if the logged-in user has access to a particular object field in Apex. In the given code, the isAccessible() method checks if the logged-in user has read access to the Expected Revenue field in the Opportunity object."
170,"A developer has fetched an opportunity from a SOQL query for which they are going to update the StageName. Before updating the record, which method is used to ensure that the logged-in user has the appropriate permissions for the field and object?
Choose one answer
A. isAccessible()
B. isWriteable()
C. isUpdatable()
D. isDeletable()

Answers:
C. isUpdatable()

Explanation:
To ensure that the logged-in user has appropriate permissions for the field and object, the isUpdatable() method is used. In the given code snippet, the if statement verifies the update permission for the StageName field using the isUpdateable() method on the Opportunity object, which refers to the current schema of the object. If the method returns false, it implies that the user does not have the required permission to update the field, and an error message is displayed accordingly. It is important to note that isUpdateable() is different from isWriteable() because isWriteable() only verifies if the field itself can be edited, whereas isUpdateable() checks if the user has the appropriate permissions for all the attributes, including the object and field permissions."

A developer creates a method in an Apex class and needs to ensure that errors are handled properly. Which three should the developer use?
Choose three answers
A. ApexPages.addErrorMessage()
B. A custom exception
C. .addError()
D. Database.handleException()
E. A try/catch construct

Answers: B, C, E
Explanation: To handle errors properly, a developer should use a try/catch construct in their Apex code to catch any Exceptions that might occur. Additionally, they should create a custom exception to handle any errors specific to their code, and use the .addError() method to add an error to a record that fails validation. ApexPages.addErrorMessage() is used to add an error message to a page in Visualforce. Database.handleException() is not a valid Apex method. 

Explain how SOQL differs from SQL.
Write your answer below.

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) is a querying language designed specifically for Salesforce. While both SOQL and SQL (Structured Query Language) share similarities in syntax and basic structure, they have important differences. 

One key difference is that SOQL is tailored to query and retrieve data from objects (tables) and their associated fields (columns) in Salesforce, whereas SQL can retrieve data from a variety of database systems. Additionally, SOQL can handle relationships between objects (joins) and perform aggregate queries to calculate summary data, which can be useful in reports and dashboards in Salesforce. 

Another difference is that SOQL is a read-only language, meaning that it cannot modify data in the database or perform certain tasks that SQL can, such as creating a table or altering a column datatype. SOQL also utilizes specific keywords like 'LIMIT' and 'OFFSET' which differ from similar SQL query elements. 

Overall, while SOQL and SQL share similarities, SOQL is developed and optimized for interacting with Salesforce objects and their fields, and is limited in its ability to perform complex database management tasks. 

Explain SOQL vulnerabilities.
Write your answer below.

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) vulnerabilities arise from the use of improper or unsecured code practices by developers, and can lead to a number of security risks.

One key vulnerability is SOQL injection attacks, which occur when an attacker attempts to insert malicious code into a SOQL statement by manipulating user input. This can lead to sensitive data being compromised or deleted, and can render an organization susceptible to data theft or loss. To mitigate this vulnerability, developers should avoid using dynamic string concatenation to build their SOQL queries, and instead use parameterized queries that can provide safe and secure access to the database.

Other vulnerabilities include the misuse of permissions and access control, as well as the improper handling of exceptions and errors in SOQL code. These can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system functionality, or can result in data loss due to unhandled errors causing unexpected system behavior.

Overall, developers must be mindful of SOQL vulnerabilities and adhere to secure coding standards to ensure the safety and integrity of Salesforce data and functionality. 

Learn to prevent SOQL injection attacks.
Write your answer below.

To prevent SOQL injection attacks in Salesforce, developers should follow best practices in secure coding and avoid using dynamic string concatenation to build SOQL queries. This involves using parameterized queries instead, which can provide safe and secure access to the database.

Some specific steps developers can take include:

1. Use bind variables: Bind variables allow a developer to pass user input into a SOQL query as a parameter, rather than as part of the query string. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that input is properly sanitized and escaped.

2. Validate user input: Developers should sanitize and validate user input before using it in a SOQL query, to prevent malicious code from being inserted into the query. This can include checking for valid data types and range limits.

3. Limit access: Users should only have access to the fields and data they need, to reduce the possibility of successful SOQL injection attacks.

4. Implement security protections: Other security measures, such as IP restriction, multi-factor authentication, and encryption, can help defend against SOQL injection attacks and other threats.

Overall, preventing SOQL injection attacks involves a combination of secure coding practices, access control, and effective security implementation. By following these best practices, developers can help ensure the safety and security of Salesforce data and functionality."
175,"Rewrite:

The following code snippet retrieves a list of Books using a SOQL query based on user input. What vulnerability does this code introduce, and how can it be prevented?
```
String query = 'SELECT Id, Name, Title__c FROM Books';
String whereClause = 'Title__c like \'%'+textualTitle+'%\' ';
List<Books> whereclause_records = database.query(query+' where '+whereClause);
```

Answers: 
A. SOQL injection, by allowing user input to modify the structure of the query
B. Cross-site scripting, by allowing unvalidated input to be displayed on the page
C. Cross-site request forgery, by not using CSRF tokens to protect against forged requests
D. Session hijacking, by not implementing proper authentication and authorization

Explanation:
This code introduces a vulnerability to SOQL injection because it inserts user input directly into the SOQL query without validating it first. An attacker could modify the structure of the query to gain unauthorized access to data or execute arbitrary code. To prevent this, the developer should use bind variables instead of concatenating user input into the query string. This will properly validate the input and prevent any modification of the query structure."
176,"In order to prevent SOQL injection attacks, which two techniques can be used?
Choose two answers
A. Typecasting user input to integers
B. Using ApexPages.addErrorMessage()
C. Using string.escapeSingleQuotes()
D. Using Database.handleException()

Answers: A and C
Explanation: Typecasting is an effective technique to prevent injection attacks where user input is not expected to be a string. The platform-provided function string.escapeSingleQuotes() is another technique to prevent XSS and SOQL injection attacks by escaping any single quote marks found in the user input."
177,"Which of the following best describes the purpose of a validation rule in Salesforce?
Choose one answer.
A. To filter data based on specified criteria
B. To verify that data entered by users meets specified standards before it can be saved
C. To automate process in Salesforce
D. To create custom fields

Answer: B
Explanation: Validation rules help to ensure data integrity by verifying that data entered by users meets specific standards before it can be saved. A validation rule can contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “True” or “False.” When the validation rule returns a value of ""True,"" this confirms that the data entered contains an invalid value. Validation rules can also include error messages to display to users when they enter invalid values based on specified criteria."
178,"Which of the following correctly defines a CSRF vulnerability?
Choose one answer
A. A type of vulnerability in which an attacker can inject malicious code into a vulnerable application to bypass authentication and perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

C. A type of vulnerability in which an attacker can intercept and read sensitive information transmitted between a user and a vulnerable application
D. A type of vulnerability in which a user's session is hijacked by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in a web application

Answer: B
Explanation: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate a user's browser to perform actions without their knowledge or consent. This is typically done by tricking the user into clicking a link or submitting a form that performs an action on a vulnerable website, such as changing their password or making a purchase. 

Identify a method to prevent a CSRF vulnerability in Lightning Platform applications.
Choose one answer
A. Use session fixation techniques to prevent session ID reuse
B. Implement server-side session timeout controls 
C. Include a CSRF token in all forms and links that perform actions 
D. Encrypt all HTTP traffic between the client and the server 

Answer: C
Explanation: To prevent a CSRF vulnerability, code- and org-level protections should be implemented. One common method to prevent a CSRF vulnerability in Lightning Platform applications is to include a CSRF token in all forms and links that perform actions. This token is a unique value that is generated when the form or link is loaded, and is required to submit the form or follow the link. This helps to ensure that only actions initiated by the user will be accepted by the server.

B. MyScheduledClass.schedule('Job Name', '0 0 0 * * ?')
C. System.schedule('Job Name', '0 0 0 * * ?', MyScheduledClass)
D. MyScheduledClass.schedule('Job Name', '0 0 0 * * ?')

Answers: C
Explanation: The syntax for scheduling a method using Scheduled Apex is: System.schedule('Job Name', 'Cron expression', instance of Apex Class). In this syntax, 'Job Name' is the name of the scheduled job, 'Cron expression' is the schedule to run the job, and 'instance of Apex Class' is the name of the Apex class that contains the scheduled method.

Answer: A
Explanation: The statement in the content mentions that the sharing setting of the class where the method is defined is applied, not of the class where the method is called. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B and C are incorrect. Option D is also incorrect because it has the opposite conditions mentioned in the statement in the content."
204,"In which of the following scenarios might a user encounter permissions-related issues while working with Salesforce data? 
Choose two answers
A. Creating a new record for a custom object
B. Updating an existing record for a standard object
C. Running a SOQL query that returns a large result set
D. Executing a Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement

Answers: B, D
Explanation: A user may encounter permissions-related issues while updating an existing record for a standard object, as the user may not have the necessary permissions to perform the update. Similarly, when executing a Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement, an operation may fail if the current user doesn't have the correct permissions. In contrast, creating a new record for a custom object or running a SOQL query with a large result set does not typically involve permissions-related issues."
205,"Which method should be used to check if the logged-in user has Edit permission on a field and Create permission on an object before inserting a record into the database?
Choose one answer.
A. isUpdateable()
B. isCreateable()
C. isAccessible()
D. isDeletable()

Answers: B
Explanation: Before inserting a record into the database, it is important to verify that the logged-in user has both Edit permission on the field and Create permission on the object. This can be done by using the `isCreateable()` method on the particular object. In this case, to ensure that the user calling the function has authorization to create opportunities and opportunity amounts, the Apex code should perform a check to see if the user has the create permission on `isCreateable()` permission on `Opportunity.Amount`."

210,"What is the purpose of translating a dynamic SOQL query into a static query?
Choose one answer
A. To improve query performance 
B. To allow for dynamic variables to be used in the query
C. To prevent SOQL injection attacks 
D. To simplify the query syntax

Answers: C
Explanation: Translating a dynamic SOQL query into a static query can prevent SOQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input (the var variable) is not used directly in the query. By using a static query, the corresponding variables are separately bound rather than being concatenated to form the query string, which eliminates the possibility of malicious user input disrupting the query syntax."
211,"In order to prevent SOQL injection, which technique can be used to ensure that erroneous user input is not permitted when applicable?
Choose one answer
A. Dynamic queries
B. Typecasting
C. Database.query()
D. String.valueOf()

Answers: B
Explanation: As stated in the provided content, typecasting can be used to prevent SOQL injection by casting variables as integers or Booleans, when applicable, to prevent erroneous user input. They can then be transformed back to a string for insertion into the query using string.valueOf(). This technique ensures that user input remains within expected limits. Dynamic queries, database.query() and String.valueOf() are not applicable to the use case of preventing SOQL injection by ensuring that erroneous user input is not permitted."
212,"Which field does the upsert statement use to match sObjects with existing records in Salesforce?
Choose one answer
A. Email
B. ID
C. LastName
D. Department

Answers: B
Explanation: The upsert statement matches sObjects with existing records by comparing values of one field. By default, the upsert statement uses the sObject's ID to match the sObject with existing records in Salesforce. Alternatively, you can specify a field to use for matching. For custom objects, specify a custom field marked as external ID. For standard objects, you can specify any field that has the idLookup property set to true. For example, the email field of Contact or User has the idLookup property set."
213,"What is the purpose of the optional allOrNone parameter in Database methods?
Choose one answer
A. To specify the type of records being inserted
B. To determine whether the operation should be immediate
C. To specify whether the operation should partially succeed
D. To determine how records will be deleted

Answer: C
Explanation: The optional allOrNone parameter in Database methods is used to specify whether the operation should partially succeed. This is done by setting the parameter to false, which allows the successful records to be committed and errors to be returned for the failed records. When the parameter is set to true, the Database method behaves like its DML statement counterpart and will throw an exception if a failure is encountered."
214,"Which DML operation is used to insert new records in Salesforce?

Choose one answer
A. It allows for the use of a QueryLocator to retrieve records
B. It enables transactions to be grouped together as a single transaction
C. It maintains state across all transactions
D. It ensures that the start() method provides the collection of all records that the execute() method will process in individual batches

Answers: C
Explanation: When using Database.Stateful in a Batch Apex class, state can be maintained across all transactions. This is useful for cases where instance member variables need to retain their values between transactions, such as counting or summarizing records as they're processed."
217,"When querying related records in Apex, which method should be used to construct a SOQL query?
Choose one answer
A. ApexPages.addErrorMessage()
B. ApexPages.addQuery()
C. RELATED_OBJECT_NAME.(field)
D. SELECT (field) FROM RELATED_OBJECT_NAME

Answers: C
Explanation: The correct method to use is to reference the related object name in the query and select the desired fields. For example, if querying the related Contacts of an Account, the SOQL query syntax would be ""SELECT (field) FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :accountId""."

Explanation: In the provided content, it states that SOQL can be embedded in Apex code to read records from Salesforce. Therefore, when testing Apex code that includes SOQL queries, it falls under the Development Testing category."
219,"In Salesforce, what is the preferred method for iterating over all of the sObject records returned by a SOQL query, to avoid reaching governor limits?
Choose one answer
A. Using a for loop
B. Using a do-while loop
C. Using a while loop
D. Using recursion

Answers: A
Explanation: The preferred method to iterate over all of the sObject records returned by a SOQL query is using a for loop. Specifically, using the sObject list format syntax, which allows you to work on batches of records and perform DML operations in batch, which helps avoid reaching governor limits. With a SOQL for loop, you can include a SOQL query within a for loop. The results of a SOQL query can be iterated over within the loop. SOQL for loops use a different method for retrieving records—records are retrieved using efficient chunking with calls to the query and queryMore methods of the SOAP API."
220,"Which of the following benefits are offered by Queueable Apex over future methods?
Choose three answers
A. The ability to use non-primitive types in the class
B. The ability to monitor the progress of the job
C. The ability to call the method using a System.enqueueJob() method
D. The ability to define start and finish methods
E. The ability to handle exceptions with a try/catch construct

Answers: A, B, C
Explanation: Queueable Apex is a superset of future methods and offers several benefits over them. One of these benefits is the ability to use non-primitive types in the class. Another benefit is the ability to monitor the progress of the job, which is done by invoking the System.enqueueJob() method that returns the ID of the AsyncApexJob record. Finally, Queueable Apex does not require start and finish methods to be defined, unlike future methods. The other options, defining start and finish methods and handling exceptions with a try/catch construct, are not unique benefits of Queueable Apex over future methods."
221,"Which scenario is an ideal use case for Queueable Apex?
Choose one answer
A. Making a callout to an external REST endpoint
B. Querying for a list of sObject records
C. Processing a record trigger synchronously
D. Updating a single record

Answers: A
Explanation: Queueable Apex is ideal for scenarios where you need to perform long running operations such as making a callout to an external REST endpoint. Because @future methods are limited to primitive data types (or arrays or collections of primitives), queueable Apex can be used to process complex data types such as sObject records. Additionally, queueable Apex is ideal for making updates to sObject records asynchronously."
222,"In Queueable Apex, what is job chaining and how is it achieved?
Choose one answer
A. Running multiple jobs concurrently in a single execution context
B. Running jobs sequentially by submitting a new job from the execute() method of a queueable class
C. Running multiple jobs sequentially in the same execute() method of a queueable class
D. Running jobs in parallel by submitting multiple jobs from the execute() method of a queueable class

Answer: B
Explanation: Job chaining in Queueable Apex allows for running jobs sequentially by submitting a new job from the execute() method of a queueable class. Only one child job can exist for each parent job, and you can’t chain queueable jobs in an Apex test. To avoid errors, check if Apex is running in test context before chaining jobs using Test.isRunningTest()."

229,"In Apex, what method should a developer use to schedule a job?
Choose one answer
A. Batch.call()
B. System.schedule()
C. Schedulable.schedule()
D. Job.schedule()

Answer: B
Explanation: To schedule a job in Apex, a developer should use the System.schedule() method. This method takes three arguments: a name for the job, a CRON expression used to represent the time and date the job is scheduled to run, and an instance of a class that implements the Schedulable interface. The user's timezone is used for the basis of all schedules, but the method runs in system mode—all classes are executed, whether or not the user has permission to execute the class. It's important to note that if a trigger is used to schedule a class, extreme care must be taken to ensure that the trigger won't add more scheduled job classes than the limit."

Choose two answers
A. Before triggers
B. After triggers
C. During triggers
D. Pre-triggers

Answers: A, B
Explanation: The two types of triggers in Salesforce are before triggers and after triggers. Before triggers are used to update or validate record values before they’re saved to the database. After triggers are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.

In Salesforce trigger context variables, which variable is used to iterate over each record in a trigger for loop?
Choose one answer
A. Trigger.new
B. Trigger.old
C. Trigger.isBefore
D. Trigger.isAfter

Answers: A
Explanation: In Salesforce trigger context variables, Trigger.new contains all the records that were inserted in insert or update triggers. It is used to iterate over each record in a trigger for loop. Trigger.old provides the old version of sObjects before they were updated in update triggers, or a list of deleted sObjects in delete triggers. Triggers can fire when one record is inserted or when many records are inserted in bulk via the API or Apex. Therefore, context variables, such as Trigger.new, can contain only one record or multiple records. You can iterate over Trigger.new to get each individual sObject."

Choose one answer
A. isCreateable()
B. isUpdatable()
C. isCreatable() and isEditable()
D. isCreateable() and isModifyable()

Answers: D
Explanation: The method to determine if the user has create permission on an object and edit permission on a specific field is by using the isCreateable() and isModifyable() methods in Apex. The correct code snippet for this would be `Schema.SObjectType.Opportunity.fields.Amount.isCreateable() && Schema.SObjectType.Opportunity.fields.Amount.isUpdateable()`. By using this code snippet in your Apex code, you can ensure that the current user has both the necessary permissions before creating a new Opportunity record with the $500 amount value."

Choose one answer
A. Opportunity record is created successfully
B. Opportunity record is not created and an error message is displayed
C. The code throws a runtime exception
D. The code compiles successfully but throws a null pointer exception during runtime

Answers: B
Explanation: The code checks if the running user has create access on the Amount field in the Opportunity object using the isCreateable() method. If the running user does not have the necessary permission, ApexPages.addMessage() method adds an error message to the page and the record is not created. In this case, the code will display the error message ""Error: Insufficient Access"" and return null. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

Explanation: Record types are used to differentiate between different types of records within an object. They allow different page layouts, picklist values, and business processes to be defined for each record type. This is particularly useful when there are different business processes (e.g. sales, support, etc.) that require different fields to be filled out for different types of records. Record types can be used for both standard and custom objects, and they can be used in both Lightning Experience and Classic."
306,"When should a developer consider using the @future annotation in an Apex trigger?
Choose one answer
A. When making a callout to an external service
B. When performing a large number of DML statements
C. When querying a large number of records
D. When executing a long-running process

Answers: A
Explanation: The @future annotation should be used in an Apex trigger when making a callout to an external service. This is because callouts are made asynchronously, meaning that they are done in a separate thread of execution. Using the @future annotation ensures that callouts are done asynchronously and that the trigger does not exceed the synchronous limits on SOQL queries and DML statements."

321,"Create a record-triggered flow to maintain data consistency and update another record to improve performance. In which scenario should the fine-tuned timing options be used with a record-triggered flow?
Choose one answer
A. When you want the changes made to the record to take effect before the user sees it
B. When you want to initiate a process before any validation rules are enforced
C. When you want to avoid conflicts with other related records that might be changing at the same time
D. When you want to ensure that no other automation runs during the transaction

Answers: C
Explanation: Option C is correct because using fine-tuned timing options helps to avoid conflicts with other related records that might be changing at the same time. The initial triggering transaction has already sent the changed record to the database, and the flow can use this transaction to make further changes or updates. By using the fine-tuned timing options, the record-triggered flow can be sure to run at the appropriate time and avoid any conflicts with other related records. Option A is incorrect because the timing options do not affect when the changes are visible to the user. Option B is incorrect because the timing options do not affect when validation rules are enforced.

Choose two answers
A. Enforcing CRUD/FLS
B. Enforcing query filters
C. Preventing data duplication
D. Enabling territory management

Answers: A, B
Explanation: Enforcing CRUD/FLS and query filters are two use cases that require a sharing rule to be enforced. CRUD/FLS ensures that users only have access to the data they are authorized to view or modify, while query filters limit data visibility to specific criteria.

In Apex, which statement is used to enforce CRUD and FLS permissions?
Choose one answer
A. Schema.SObjectType
B. Schema.describeSObjects()
C. Schema.getGlobalDescribe()
D. Schema.SObjectField

Answers: A
Explanation: The Schema.SObjectType statement is used to enforce CRUD and FLS permissions in Apex. It allows developers to get metadata information about an object, including its fields and permissions settings.

A developer needs to protect against CRUD/FLS violations in their Apex code. Which two approaches should the developer take?
Choose two answers
A. Use the Schema class to enforce FLS permissions
B. Use the with sharing keyword to limit data access

Explanation: Enforcing sharing rules and protecting against XSS attacks are critical to ensure the security of Apex code. Visualforce pages do not play a role in this. Additionally, it is not recommended to use system mode for all code as it bypasses user permissions and sharing rules."
372,"Which keyword should a developer use to indicate that sharing rules for the current user must be enforced in an Apex class?
Choose one answer:
A. without sharing
B. with sharing
C. inherited sharing
D. System context

Answers: 
B. with sharing 

Explanation: 
The with sharing keyword lets you specify that the sharing rules for the current user are considered for the class, which means that the sharing rules enforced for the current user will be applied to the class. This keyword needs to be explicitly set for the class because Apex code normally runs in system context, which means that Apex code has access to all objects and fields without regard to the user-specific access settings. The inherited sharing keyword, on the other hand, applies the sharing mode of the parent class, while the without sharing keyword specifies that the sharing rules for the current user are not enforced."
373,"Which Salesforce feature can be used to enforce object-level and field-level permissions?
Choose one answer
A. WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED clause
B. Custom Exceptions
C. ApexPages.addErrorMessage()
D. Database.handleException()

Answers: A
Explanation: The WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED clause in SOQL queries can be used to enforce object-level and field-level permissions in Salesforce. In addition, the Schema.DescribeSObjectResult methods and Schema.DescribeFieldResult methods can be called in Apex code to check the current user's access permission levels. This helps to verify whether the current user has the necessary permission before performing specific DML operations or queries. The other options listed are related to handling errors in Apex code but are not directly related to enforcing permissions."

382,"In the code snippet provided, what security vulnerability is present?
Choose one answer
A. Cross-site scripting
B. Authentication bypass
C. SQL injection
D. Cross-site request forgery

Answers: C
Explanation: The code is vulnerable to SOQL injection as it inserts a user-submitted parameter directly into the SOQL query, allowing an attacker to modify the query's structure. This behavior can be exploited to access or alter data, compromise the security of the application, or execute malicious code. It is essential to use prepared statements or bind variables to prevent this vulnerability."
383,"In Salesforce, to prevent SOQL injection attacks, what is one way developers can protect user-controlled strings in their queries?

389,"Which keyword should a developer use in an Apex class to take into account sharing rules for the current user?
Choose one answer
A. with sharing
B. without sharing
C. sharing rules
D. system context

Answers: A
Explanation: To take into account sharing rules for the current user, a developer should use the with sharing keyword in an Apex class. By default, Apex executes in system context where all objects and fields are accessible and sharing rules aren't applied for the current user. Using the with sharing keyword enforces sharing rules for the current user. Using the without sharing keyword explicitly ignores sharing rules. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Sharing rules is a concept or feature in Salesforce, and not a keyword in Apex. Similarly, system context is also a term to describe the default execution mode of Apex but not a keyword. Therefore options C and D are incorrect."
390,"Describe the importance of enforcing sharing rules in Apex.
Choose one answer
A. Apex classes have access to all data within an organization.
B. Sharing rules help determine the execution context under which code runs.
C. Apex code runs in system context and therefore does not enforce sharing rules.
D. Web services should not be restricted by permissions as they always execute with full permissions of the current user.

Answers: B
Explanation: Apex classes by default have the ability to read and update all data within an organization. Enforcing sharing rules is important because it helps determine the “execution context” under which your code executes. The “system mode” runs with access privileges to many resources, while the “user mode” enforces the permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules of the current user. Apex code generally runs in system context which means that object permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules aren’t applied for the current user. This ensures that code doesn’t fail to run because of hidden fields or objects for a user. However, sharing rules are enforced in classes that are declared with the with sharing keyword."
391,"What method should a developer use to verify if a user has permission to read the Expected Revenue field of an Opportunity object before retrieving it in Apex code?

Choose one answer

396,"Write a new exam question using the specified format but based on the content provided.

Format:

In Apex, what is the best way to make calls to external web services from a trigger?
Choose one answer
A. Use a synchronous callout to avoid delays in the trigger process.
B. Use a REST API callout to directly access the external web service.
C. Use a future method annotated with @future(callout=true) to make the callout asynchronously.
D. Use a batch Apex process to offload the callout to a scheduled job.

Answers:
C. Use a future method annotated with @future(callout=true) to make the callout asynchronously.

Explanation:
When making calls to external web services from a trigger in Apex, it is important to do so asynchronously to avoid delays in the trigger process. One way to do this is to use a future method annotated with @future(callout=true). This method executes in a background process and allows the trigger to continue processing without waiting for the external service's response. Option A is incorrect as it suggests using a synchronous callout, which would cause delays in the trigger process. Option B is incorrect as it suggests using a REST API callout, which is not necessary when using a future method. Option D is incorrect as it suggests using a batch Apex process, which would not offload the callout to a scheduled job."

Answers: C
Explanation: To use Queueable Apex, a class must implement the Queueable interface.

A developer wants to update a collection of Account records and execute some processing such as making a callout to an external REST endpoint or perform some calculations before updating the records in the database in the most efficient way possible. Which Queueable Apex class is the best choice for this scenario?
Choose one answer
A. @future method
B. Queueable Apex
C. Apex Batch
D. Apex Scheduler

Answers: B
Explanation: Queueable Apex is the ideal choice for this scenario since @future methods are limited to primitive data types (or arrays or collections of primitives). With Queueable Apex, the developer can work with collections of sObject records and update them asynchronously."
405,"What is the purpose of job chaining in Queueable Apex?
Choose one answer
A. To run jobs simultaneously 
B. To check if Apex is running in test context 
C. To run jobs sequentially 
D. To add multiple child jobs to a single parent job 

Answers: C
Explanation: Job chaining is used to run jobs sequentially and one-at-a-time. By chaining a job to another job, you can add only one job from an executing job, which means that only one child job can exist for each parent job. Using this feature, you can create a chain of jobs that run one after the other.

Note that it’s also important to remember that you cannot chain queueable jobs in an Apex test, doing so results in an error. You can avoid this by checking if Apex is running in test context by calling Test.isRunningTest() before chaining jobs."

Choose one answer
A. Scalability Testing
B. Development Testing
C. Quality Assurance Testing 
D. Batch Data Testing

Answers: B
Explanation: 
Bulk testing sandbox is used for testing large volume of data, which is primarily used in development testing. The sandbox provides an environment that simulates the production system and can handle the volume of data needed for this kind of testing. In the given context, if developers are designing their code to work with a single record, they would need to re-design their code to work with a large volume of data, which can be tested using the bulk testing sandbox. Therefore, the use case that requires a bulk testing sandbox is Development Testing."
413,"What is being tested in the following code snippet:
public static void CreateNewOpportunity(List<Account> accts) {
    List<Opportunity> opps = new List<Opportunity>();
    for (Account a : accts) {
        Opportunity opp = new Opportunity();
        opp.Name = a.Name + ' Opportunity';

This is useful for scenarios that require data manipulation like maintenance. Testing scenarios do not require the use of the batchable interface."
415,"What is the purpose of the execute() method in a class that implements the Queueable interface?
Choose one answer.
A. It loops through a list of contacts and performs a callout for each of them.
B. It logs the response to a custom object.
C. It initializes a list of contacts that will be processed.
D. It invokes the Queueable Apex.

Answer: A
Explanation: The execute() method in a class that implements the Queueable interface is responsible for defining the actual work that needs to be done in a separate, asynchronous process. In this specific example, the method loops through the list of contacts passed in through the constructor and performs a callout for each of them using a separate method. The logic for logging the response to a custom object is also included in this method."

This reduces the likelihood of errors occurring in the system and improves overall code quality."
417,"Which of the following is a benefit of Apex unit tests?
Choose one answer
A. Writing Apex code in production org
B. Meeting the code coverage requirements for deploying Apex
C. Altering the behavior in your custom code as a result of service upgrades
D. Testing your Visualforce pages

Answers: B
Explanation: Apex unit tests ensure that at least 75% of Apex code is covered by tests and passes before deploying to production or distributing to customers. This requirement ensures high-quality apps delivered to production org or package subscribers, which makes production users more productive and increases customer trust. Writing Apex code in production org is not recommended, as Apex code can only be developed in a sandbox environment or a Developer org. Altering the behavior in your custom code as a result of service upgrades is prevented with a process called Apex Hammer which runs all Apex tests on your behalf to ensure that the behavior in your custom code hasn’t been altered. Testing your Visualforce pages is not a benefit of Apex unit tests, as Apex unit tests are specifically for Apex classes and triggers, not Visualforce pages."
418,"A developer runs tests and checks code coverage percentage in the Tests tab of the Developer Console. What should the developer do whenever they modify their Apex code?

Explanation: In order to have the most robust code, developers should aim for 100% test coverage. While 75% coverage is the minimum required for deployments and packages on the Lightning Platform, higher coverage is always better."
420,"Which is a best practice when setting up test data in Apex?
Choose one answer
A. Use @isTest(SeeAllData=true) to access pre-existing data.
B. Create test data in a separate database.
C. Roll back test data when the test finishes execution.
D. Use a utility test class to create test data.

Answers: D
Explanation: It is a best practice to use a utility test class to create test data. This makes your tests more robust and prevents failures that are caused by missing or changed data in the org. By default, Apex tests don’t have access to pre-existing data in the org, except for access to setup and metadata objects, such as the User or Profile objects. Using @isTest(SeeAllData=true) to access pre-existing data is not recommended because it can lead to tests that are not isolated and therefore not reliable. Rollback behavior is handy for testing because you don’t have to clean up your test data after the test executes, and creating a separate database for testing is not possible."

A. A test that attempts to delete an account record without related opportunities
B. A test that deletes an account record with related opportunities
C. A test that updates an account with related opportunities
D. A test that creates an account record with related opportunities

Answers: B
Explanation: The trigger is designed to prevent the deletion of an account record with related opportunities, so a unit test should be created to delete an account record with related opportunities and verify that the trigger prevented the deletion. Option A is incorrect because the trigger is not designed to prevent the deletion of an account without related opportunities. Option C and D are also incorrect as they are not related to the trigger being tested."
427,"In Apex triggers, why is it recommended to use bulk design patterns?
Choose one answer
A. It results in shorter code
B. It saves server resources and minimizes exceeding platform limits
C. It improves user interface performance
D. It reduces the number of governor limits

Answers: B
Explanation: Using bulk design patterns in Apex triggers is recommended because it saves server resources, allows the trigger to operate more efficiently, and reduces the chance of exceeding platform limits. It is important to optimize code when processing large numbers of records in triggers to keep the governor limits in check."
428,"Write an exam question based on the following content:

Future methods are frequently used for asynchronous Apex processing. When it comes to future methods, one of the best practices is preparing to handle exceptions. What shouldn’t you do when it comes to handling exceptions in future methods?

Answers:
A. Catch and handle exceptions in the future method
B. Log the exception in a custom log object
C. Throw the exception to the calling method
D. Ignore the exception altogether

Explanation:
Future methods are often used to run Apex processing asynchronously. Therefore, it is key to anticipate exception handling. One should not ignore exceptions while dealing with future methods. Doing so would leave errors unnoticed, which can later cause all sorts of problems. Ignoring exceptions should be avoided at all times."
